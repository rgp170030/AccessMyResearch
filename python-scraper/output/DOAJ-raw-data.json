Descriptive methods were used in this study to determine current level of teachers\u2019 digital empowerment. It was found that teachers have average levels of digital enpowerment. Looking closer at sub-categories, it was found that their awareness and motivation levels were higher, however, technical access and empowerment levels were average. Comparing males and females showed that both teachers had high scores on awareness and technical access but motivation, empowerment, and over all males and females were roughly average. When sub\u00adcategories of digital empowerment was analyzed according to teachers\u2019 specialties, it showed that Computer and Science teachers\u2019 had high scores on awareness, motivation, technical access empowerment and overall average.

In this mode, train attendants observe the railway condition ahead using the traditional manual method and tell the observation results to the driver in order to avoid danger. To address this problem, an automatic object detection system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to detect objects ahead in shunting mode, which is called Feature Fusion Refine neural network (FR-Net). It consists of three connected modules, i.e., the depthwise-pointwise convolution, the coarse detection module, and the object detection module. Depth-wise-pointwise convolutions are used to improve the detection in real time. The coarse detection module coarsely refine the locations and sizes of prior anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent module and also reduces search space for the classification, whereas the object detection module aims to regress accurate object locations and predict the class labels for the prior anchors. The experimental results on the railway traffic dataset show that FR-Net achieves 0.8953 mAP with 72.3 FPS performance on a machine with a GeForce GTX1080Ti with the input size of 320 &times; 320 pixels.

The preregulator delivered an internal power voltage of 3 V and supplied internal circuits including the second module (the linear regulator core). The preregulator fitted with an active, low-pass filter provided a low-noise reference voltage to the linear regulator core circuit.

The circuit was successfully implemented in a 0.25 &#181;m, 5 V complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process featuring 20 V drain-extended MOS (DMOS)/bipolar high-voltage devices. The total silicon area, including all pads, was approximately 1.67 mm<sup>2</sup>. To reduce chip area, bipolar rather than DMOS transistors served as the power transistors.

Recent increases in the adoption of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) have made building electrical consumption data available, and this has increased the feasibility of data-driven load forecasting. Self-organizing map (SOM) has been successfully utilized to cluster a dataset into subsets containing similar data points. These subsets are then used to train the forecasting models to improve forecasting accuracy. However, some buildings may have insufficient data since newly installed monitoring devices such as AMI have no choice but to collect a limited amount of data. Using a clustering technique on small datasets could lead to overfitting when using forecasting models following an SOM network to be trained with clusters. This results in a relatively high generalization error.

While considerable research has focused on ORN responses to odorants, the mechanisms by which olfactory information is encoded in the activities of ORNs and translated into navigational behavior remain poorly understood. We sought to determine the contributions of most Drosophila melanogaster larval ORNs to navigational behavior. Using odorants to activate ORNs and a larval tracking assay to measure the corresponding behavioral response, we observed that larval ORN activators cluster into four groups based on the behavior responses elicited from larvae. This is significant because it provides new insights into the functional relationship between ORN activity and behavioral response. Subsequent optogenetic analyses of a subset of ORNs revealed previously undescribed properties of larval ORNs. Furthermore, our results indicated that different temporal patterns of ORN activation elicit different behavioral outputs: some ORNs respond to stimulus increments while others respond to stimulus decrements. These results suggest that the ability of ORNs to encode temporal patterns of stimulation increases the coding capacity of the olfactory circuit. Moreover, the ability of ORNs to sense stimulus increments and decrements facilitates instantaneous evaluations of concentration changes in the environment. Together, these ORN properties enable larvae to efficiently navigate a complex olfactory environment.

The landscape factors and physicochemical parameters of the water were analysed in order to gain an understanding of the pattern of water mite assemblages in the riparian springs. Three limnological types of springs were examined (helocrenes, limnocrenes and rheocrenes) along the whole course of the river and a total of 35 water mite species were found. Our study shows that flooding influences spring assemblages, causing a decrease in crenobiontic water mites in flooded springs. The impact of intermittency resulted in a high percentage of species typical of temporary water bodies. Surprisingly, the study revealed the positive impact of the anthropogenic transformation of the river valley: preventing the riparian springs from flooding enhances the diversity of crenobiontic species in non-flooded springs. In the conclusion, our study revealed that further conservation strategies for the protection of the riparian springs along large rivers would take into account ongoing climatic changes and possible the positive impact of the anthropogenic transformation of river valleys.", "title": "Water mites (Acari, Hydrachnidia) of riparian springs in a small lowland river valley: what are the key factors for species distribution?"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-05-26T16:05:13Z", "id": "000071feca1a4943b28016fe1f5b7b9f"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:00:32Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/ijms21145120", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1422-0067", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "1661-6596", "type": "pissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "21", "number": "5120", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section"}], "issns": ["1422-0067", "1661-6596"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences"}, "month": "07", "keywords": ["swallow", "breathing", "central pattern generators", "serotonin", "neuromodulation"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "5120", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}, {"code": "QD1-999", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Chemistry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9 and INSERM, Institut de Neurosciences des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 1106, Bd Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France", "name": "Victor Berg\u00e9-Laval"}, {"affiliation": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9 and INSERM, Institut de Neurosciences des Syst\u00e8mes, UMR 1106, Bd Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France", "name": "Christian Gestreau"}], "link": [{"content_type": "text/html", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/14/5120"}], "abstract": "Pharmacological neuromodulation of swallowing may represent a promising therapeutic option to treat dysphagia. Previous studies suggested a serotonergic control of swallowing, but mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of the serotonergic agonist quipazine on swallowing, using the arterially perfused working heart-brainstem (in situ) preparation in rats. Systemic injection of quipazine produced single swallows with motor patterns and swallow-breathing coordination similar to spontaneous swallows, and increased swallow rate with moderate changes in cardiorespiratory functions. Methysergide, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, blocked the excitatory effect of quipazine on swallowing, but had no effect on spontaneous swallow rate. Microinjections of quipazine in the nucleus of the solitary tract were without effect. In contrast, similar injections in caudal medullary raphe nuclei increased swallow rate without changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. Thus, quipazine may exert an excitatory effect on raphe neurons via stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors, leading to increased excitability of the swallowing network. In conclusion, we suggest that pharmacological stimulation of swallowing by quipazine in situ represents a valuable model for experimental studies.

In this study, we focus on deciphering the interplay between members of the DUSP family with protein kinases in immune cells using publicly available omics datasets. Our analysis resulted in the identification of potential DUSP-mediated hub proteins including MAPK7, MAPK8, AURKA, and IGF1R.

Cofilin-1 (CFL-1) and its modulators, LIMK1/SSH1, play key roles in mediating the invasiveness by driving actin cytoskeleton reorganization in various cancer types. However, their clinical significance and prognostic value in CRC has not been fully explored. Here, we evaluated the clinical contribution of these actin regulators according to TNM and consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) classification. Methods CFL-1, LIMK1 and SSH1 mRNA/protein levels were assessed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses using normal adjacent and tumor tissues obtained from a clinical cohort of CRC patients. The expression levels of these proteins were associated with clinicopathological features by using the chi square test. In addition, using RNA-Seq data of CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we determine how these actin regulators are expressed and distributed according to TNM and CMSs classification. Based on gene expression profiling, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to evaluated overall survival. Results Bioinformatic analysis revealed that LIMK1 expression was upregulated in all tumor stages. Patients with high levels of LIMK1 demonstrated significantly lower overall survival rates and exhibited greater lymph node metastatic potential in a clinical cohort. In contrast, CFL-1 and SSH1 have expression downregulated in all tumor stages. However, immunohistochemical analyses showed that patients with high protein levels of CFL-1 and SSH1 exhibited greater lymph node metastatic potential and greater depth of local invasion. In addition, using the CMSs classification to evaluate different biological phenotypes of CRC, we observed that LIMK1 and SSH1 genes are upregulated in immune (CMS1) and mesenchymal (CMS4) subtypes. However, patients with high levels of LIMK1 also demonstrated significantly lower overall survival rates in canonical (CMS2), and metabolic (CMS3) subtypes. Conclusions We demonstrated that CFL-1 and its modulators, LIMK1/SSH1, are differentially expressed and associated with lymph node metastasis in CRC. Finally, this expression profile may be useful to predict patients with aggressive signatures, particularly, the immune and mesenchymal subtypes of CRC.", "title": "Cofilin-1, LIMK1 and SSH1 are differentially expressed in locally advanced colorectal cancer and according to consensus molecular subtypes", "journal": {"volume": "21", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "issns": ["1475-2867"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Cancer Cell International"}, "month": "1", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0001a89618e245a09f4de003f237cc99", "created_date": "2021-01-24T12:19:16Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:35:43Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-302X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fmicb.2017.02268", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "8", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/microbiology#about"}], "issns": ["1664-302X"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Microbiology"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["Cronobacter spp.", "Cronobacter malonaticus", "invasive", "outer membrane proteins (OMPs)", "proteomics", "flagellin"], "year": "2017", "subject": [{"code": "QR1-502", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Microbiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom", "name": "Maha A.

To date most studies have focussed on C. sakazakii as it is the major species associated with neonatal infections. However, recently C. malonaticus, in particular sequence type 7 (ST7), has been noted as being prevalent in adult infections and therefore warranting further investigation. In this study, eight strains of C. malonaticus ST7, that had been isolated from a wide range of sources and varied in their in vitro virulence, were chosen for proteomic analysis of their outer membrane proteins (OMPs). One-dimensional gel analysis revealed a ~29 kDa size band that was only present in the highly invasive strains. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis identified several peptides that matched the flagellin protein. The presence of flagellin protein was confirmed in 2D gel spot. Mass spectrometry analysis of total OMPs revealed that the four highly invasive C. malonaticus strains expressed the main flagellum proteins that were absent from the four low invasive strains. These were the flagellar hook protein FlgE, flagellar hook-associated protein 1, flagellar hook-associated protein, flagellin, and flagellar hook-filament junction protein FlgL.

Caterpillars feeding on different pine subspecies had distinct overall metabolome structure, accounting for over 10% of the total variability. Although plants and insects have very divergent metabolomes, caterpillars showed certain resemblance to their plant-host metabolome. In addition, few plant-related secondary metabolites were found accumulated in caterpillar tissues which could potentially be used for self-defense. Caterpillars feeding on N and P richer needles had lower N and P tissue concentration and higher C:N and C:P ratios, suggesting that nutrient transfer is not necessarily linear through trophic levels and other plant-metabolic factors could be interfering.

Two sand fly genera, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia,\u00a0contain species that are present in the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus where the visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) and canine (CanLei) leishmaniases are a public health concern. The risk of transmission of different Leishmania species can be studied in an area by monitoring their vectors. Sand fly species are traditionally identified using morphological characteristics but minute differences between individuals or populations could be overlooked leading to wrong epidemiological predictions. Molecular identification of these important vectors has become, therefore, an essential tool for research tasks concerning their geographical distribution which directly relates to leishmaniasis control efforts. DNA barcoding is a widely used molecular identification method for cataloguing animal species by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome oxidase I. Results DNA barcoding was used to identify individuals of five sand fly species (Phlebotomus papatasi, P. similis, P. killicki, Sergentomyia minuta, S. dentata) circulating in the islands of Crete and Cyprus during the years 2011\u20132014. Phlebotomus papatasi is a known vector of zoonotic CL in the Middle East and it is found in both islands. Phlebotomus similis is the suspected vector of Leishmania tropica in Greece causing anthroponotic CL. Phlebotomus killicki was collected in Cyprus for the first time. Sergentomyia minuta, found to present intraspecific diversity, is discussed for its potential as a Leishmania vector. Molecular identification was consistent with the morphological identification. It successfully identified males and females, which is difficult when using only morphological characters. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the barcodes acquired, representing their genetic relationships along with other species from the area studied. All individuals identified were clustered according to their species and subgenus.

We have recently shown that the hormonal environment is responsible for the fate of the corpora lutea (CL). Changing the levels of circulating hormones in post-partum rats, either by injecting androgen, progesterone, or by allowing dams to suckle, was coupled with a delay in the onset of apoptosis in the CL. The objectives of the present investigation were: i) to examine the effect of exogenous estradiol on apoptosis of the rat CL during post-partum luteal regression; and ii) to evaluate the post-partum luteal expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) genes.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>In a first experiment, rats after parturition were separated from their pups and injected daily with vehicle or estradiol benzoate for 4 days. On day 4 post-partum, animals were sacrificed, blood samples were taken to determine serum concentrations of hormones, and the ovaries were isolated to study apoptosis in situ. In a second experiment, non-lactating rats after parturition received vehicle, estradiol benzoate or estradiol benzoate plus bromoergocryptine for 4 days, and their CL were isolated and used to study apoptosis ex vivo.

Administration of bromoergocryptine blocked the increase in serum prolactin and progesterone concentrations, and DNA fragmentation induced by the estrogen treatment.

The cross talk between the microbiota and the teleost immune system shifts significantly under stress or disease scenarios rendering commensals into opportunists or pathogens. Lessons learnt from germ-free fish models as well as from oral administration of live probiotics to fish highlight the vast impact that microbiota have on immune development, antibody production, mucosal homeostasis, and resistance to stress. Future studies should dissect the specific mechanisms by which different members of the fish microbiota and the metabolites they produce interact with pathogens, with other commensals, and with the teleost immune system.", "title": "Under Pressure: Interactions between Commensal Microbiota and the Teleost Immune System"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2017-05-15T09:42:09Z", "id": "0002494a3eae4af2a2a04b944665970a"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T21:41:53Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s12958-018-0448-5", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1477-7827", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "17", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license"}], "issns": ["1477-7827"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology"}, "month": "1", "end_page": "13", "year": "2019", "start_page": "1", "subject": [{"code": "RG1-991", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Gynecology and obstetrics"}, {"code": "QH471-489", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Reproduction"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Drexel University College of Medicine", "name": "Justin Rashtian"}, {"affiliation": "HRC Fertility", "name": "Diana E.

According to its chemical structure, the studied 5812-A/C preliminary is composed of a cyclic peptide part covalently bounded with an arabinose residue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the native peptide has identified its partial structure of Leu-Asp-Gly-Ser-Gly and consisting of a Tyr residue that is supposed to have a two-component peptide nature for the molecule studied. However, the structural analysis of the antibiotic complex derived from S. roseoflavus INA-Ac-5812 is still ongoing. The mechanism of action of 5812-A/C was assessed in comparison with its most related analog, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin, given the presence in both antimicrobials of an L-kynurenine amino acid residue. The inhibitory activity of 5812-A/C against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus was similar to daptomycin. The mechanism of action of 5812-A/C was associated with the disruption of membrane integrity, which differs in comparison with daptomycin and is most similar to the antimicrobial membrane-disturbing peptides. However, 5812-A/C demonstrated a calcium-dependent mode of action. In addition, unlike daptomycin, 5812-A/C was able to penetrate mature biofilms and inhibit the metabolic activity of embedded S. aureus cells. At the same time, 5812-A/C has no hemolytic activity toward erythrocyte, but possessed weak cytotoxic activity represented by heterochromatin condensation in human buccal epithelium cells.

Hundreds of these loci have been detected, but only a small number of the underlying causative genes have been identified. The main difficulty is the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in intercross progeny and the slow process of fine-scale mapping by traditional methods. Recently, new approaches have been introduced, such as association studies with inbred lines and multigenerational crosses. These approaches are very useful for interval reduction, but generally do not provide single-gene resolution because of strong LD extending over one to several megabases. Here, we investigate the genetic structure of a natural population of mice in Arizona to determine its suitability for fine-scale LD mapping and association studies. There are three main findings: (1) Arizona mice have a high level of genetic variation, which includes a large fraction of the sequence variation present in classical strains of laboratory mice; (2) they show clear evidence of local inbreeding but appear to lack stable population structure across the study area; and (3) LD decays with distance at a rate similar to human populations, which is considerably more rapid than in laboratory populations of mice. Strong associations in Arizona mice are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart, which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes. Although other considerations, such as sample size requirements and marker discovery, are serious issues in the implementation of association studies, the genetic variation and LD results indicate that wild mice could provide a useful tool for identifying genes that cause variation in complex traits.", "title": "Linkage disequilibrium in wild mice."}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T05:53:32Z", "id": "000344bbfc124537ad70d1da71a0bda4"}, {"last_updated": "2020-12-16T00:02:52Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/app10248951", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-3417", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "10", "number": "8951", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2076-3417"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Applied Sciences"}, "month": "12", "keywords": ["additive manufacturing", "warping deformation", "K-nearest neighbors", "thermal time series", "quality prediction"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "8951", "subject": [{"code": "T", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Technology"}, {"code": "TA1-2040", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Engineering (General).

Nevertheless, the technology has limitations in terms of quality, as printed products are sometimes different from their desired designs or are inconsistent due to defects. Warping deformation, a defect involving layer shrinkage induced by the thermal residual stress generated during manufacturing processes, is a major factor in lowering the quality and raising the cost of printed products. This study utilized a variety of thermal time series data and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with dynamic time warping (DTW) to detect and predict the warping deformation in the printed parts using fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers. Multivariate thermal time series data extracted from thermocouples were trained using DTW-based KNN to classify warping deformation. The results showed that the proposed approach can predict warping deformation with an accuracy of over 80% by only using thermal time series data corresponding to 20% of the whole printing process. Additionally, the classification accuracy exhibited the promising potential of the proposed approach in warping prediction and in actual manufacturing processes, so the additional time and cost resulting from defective processes can be reduced.", "title": "Forecasting Warping Deformation Using Multivariate Thermal Time Series and K-Nearest Neighbors in Fused Deposition Modeling"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00039b7ed5184da5815bde1795af1e3f", "created_date": "2020-12-16T00:02:51Z"}, {"last_updated": "2021-02-14T12:24:19Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s13072-020-0329-y", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1756-8935", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "16", "keywords": ["Zebrafish", "Epigenetics", "Histone methyl transferases", "ATAC-seq", "Metabolism"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "QH426-470", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Genetics"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University", "name": "Marjo J. den Broeder"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences", "name": "Jarle Ballangby"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud University Nijmegen, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences", "name": "Leonie M.

This susceptibility may in part be caused by changes to the epigenetic landscape which consequently affect gene expression and lead to changes in lipid metabolism. The epigenetic modifier enhancer of zeste 2 (Ezh2) is a histone H3K27 methyltransferase implicated to play a role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. In this study, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the role of Ezh2 on lipid metabolism and chromatin status following developmental exposure to the Ezh1/2 inhibitor PF-06726304 acetate. We used the environmental chemical tributyltin (TBT) as a positive control, as this chemical is known to act on lipid metabolism via EZH-mediated pathways in mammals. Results Zebrafish embryos (0\u20135\u00a0days post-fertilization, dpf) exposed to non-toxic concentrations of PF-06726304 acetate (5\u00a0\u03bcM) and TBT (1\u00a0nM) exhibited increased lipid accumulation. Changes in chromatin were analyzed by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) at 50% epiboly (5.5 hpf). We observed 349 altered chromatin regions, predominantly located at H3K27me3 loci and mostly more open chromatin in the exposed samples. Genes associated to these loci were linked to metabolic pathways. In addition, a selection of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, adipogenesis and genes specifically targeted by PF-06726304 acetate via altered chromatin accessibility were differentially expressed after TBT and PF-06726304 acetate exposure at 5 dpf, but not at 50% epiboly stage. One gene, cebpa, did not show a change in chromatin, but did show a change in gene expression at 5 dpf. Interestingly, underlying H3K27me3 marks were significantly decreased at this locus at 50% epiboly. Conclusions Here, we show for the first time the applicability of ATAC-seq as a tool to investigate toxicological responses in zebrafish. Our analysis indicates that Ezh2 inhibition leads to a partial primed state of chromatin linked to metabolic pathways which results in gene expression changes later in development, leading to enhanced lipid accumulation. Although ATAC-seq seems promising, our in-depth assessment of the cebpa locus indicates that we need to consider underlying epigenetic marks as well.", "title": "Inhibition of methyltransferase activity of enhancer of zeste 2 leads to enhanced lipid accumulation and altered chromatin status in zebrafish", "journal": {"volume": "13", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "issns": ["1756-8935"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Epigenetics & Chromatin"}, "month": "2", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0003cd4494f74699ad761b7c77e0dcea", "created_date": "2020-02-16T12:30:19Z"}, {"last_updated": "2021-01-13T12:59:11Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1992-1098", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2413-0958", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.18470/1992-098-2020-2-150-157", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "15", "number": "2", "country": "RU", "issns": ["1992-1098", "2413-0958"], "publisher": "Kamerton", "language": ["RU"], "title": "\u00dbg Rossii: \u00c8kologi\u00e2, Razvitie"}, "month": "8", "keywords": ["vole", "population", "biogeocenosis", "calf", "litter", "cohort", "offspring", "sampling", "season of  the year", "profitable", "wintered", "age and gender composition"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "QH540-549.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Ecology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "H.M.

During this time, a survey of various biotopes of the broad-leaved forest belt was carried out, taking into account both anthropogenic loads and the season of the year.Results.\u00a0Stationary studies were carried out, taking into account the season of the year, in deciduous forest belt. Reproduction of shrub voles in the population studied takes place over five months (April\u2010August). Overwintered voles reproduce within four months (from early April to late July), females bearing three litters. Accordingly, we can say that the greatest importance in maintaining the viability of the population of this vole species falls on the overwintered yearlings of the first spring cohorts.Conclusions.\u00a0The data obtained indicate the regular dynamics of the (seasonal) age structure of the population, associated with the reproduction and death of individuals of certain age groups.

In this study, the behavior of Salmonella Typhimurium on fresh strawberries stored at refrigeration and room temperatures, as well as the effectiveness of mild heat wash treatments at 47, 50, and 53\u00b0C on bacterial survival was investigated. The modified Gompertz, Huang, log-linear, and Weibull models were used to fit bacterial growth and survival curves under different treatments. A secondary model based on linear regression was developed to describe the effect of washing temperature on the kinetic parameters of S. Typhimurium survival derived from the Weibull model. During 72 h storage, S. Typhimurium on fresh strawberries stored at 4\u00b0C was reduced by 1.35 log CFU/g and growth of 5.64 log CFU/g was observed when strawberries were stored at 25\u00b0C. Bacterial reductions of 1.22 \u00b1 0.15, 1.92 \u00b1 0.06, 2.27 \u00b1 0.07 log CFU/g were obtained when washing was carried out at 47, 50 and 53\u00b0C for 240 s, respectively. The wash temperature was an important parameter for bacterial inactivation and bacterial populations declined significantly in conjunction with washing time (p &lt; 0.05). Warm wash treatments lead the visible color changes of strawberries, showing a slightly darker appearance while acceptable. The goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the log-linear model provided a satisfactory fit to describe the bacterial survival at 4\u00b0C. According to the smaller Akaike information criterion (AIC) value, the modified Gompertz model performed slightly better than the Huang model in describing bacterial growth at 25\u00b0C. The high adj-R2 (\u22650.90) and small RMSE (\u22640.22) indicated the Weibull model better described bacterial behavior under mild heat treatments.

The purpose of this research was to study the interaction of cephalexin with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and displacement reaction using site probes.\nMethods: The interaction mechanism concerning cephalexin (CPL) with BSA was investigated using various spectroscopic methods and molecular modeling method. The binding sites number, n, apparent binding constant, K, and thermodynamic parameters, \u0394G0, \u0394H0, and \u0394S0 were considered at different temperatures. To evaluate the experimental results, molecular docking modeling was calculated.\nResults: The distance, r=1.156 nm between BSA and CPL were found in accordance with the Forster theory of non-radiation energy transfer (FRET) indicating energy transfer occurs between BSA and CPL. According to the binding parameters and \u0394G0= negative values and \u0394S0= 28.275 j mol-1K-1, a static quenching process is effective in the CPL-BSA interaction spontaneously. \u0394G0 for the CPL-BSA complex obtained from the docking simulation is -28.99 kj mol-1, which is close to experimental \u0394G of binding, -21.349 kj mol-1 that indicates a good agreement between the results of docking methods and experimental data.\nConclusion: The outcomes of spectroscopic methods revealed that the conformation of BSA changed during drug-BSA interaction. The results of FRET propose that CPL quenches the fluorescence of BSA by static quenching and FRET. The displacement study showed that phenylbutazon and ketoprofen displaced CPL, indicating that its binding site on albumin is site I and Gentamicin cannot be displaced from the binding site of CPL.

The human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii possesses at least four enzymes which generate acetyl-CoA in the nucleo-cytosol (acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS); ATP citrate lyase (ACL)), mitochondrion (branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase-complex (BCKDH)) and apicoplast (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)). Given the diverse functions of acetyl-CoA, we know very little about the role of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools in parasite physiology. Results To assess the importance and functions of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA-pools, we measured the acetylome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of parasites lacking ACL/ACS or BCKDH. We demonstrate that ACL/ACS constitute a synthetic lethal pair. Loss of both enzymes causes a halt in fatty acid elongation, hypo-acetylation of nucleo-cytosolic and secretory proteins and broad changes in gene expression. In contrast, loss of BCKDH results in an altered TCA cycle, hypo-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins and few specific changes in gene expression. We provide evidence that changes in the acetylome, transcriptome and proteome of cells lacking BCKDH enable the metabolic adaptations and thus the survival of these parasites. Conclusions Using multi-omics and molecular tools, we obtain a global and integrative picture of the role of distinct acetyl-CoA pools in T. gondii physiology. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is essential and is required for the synthesis of parasite-specific fatty acids. In contrast, loss of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA can be compensated for through metabolic adaptations implemented at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational level.", "title": "Multi-omics analysis delineates the distinct functions of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools in Toxoplasma gondii", "journal": {"volume": "18", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/about"}], "issns": ["1741-7007"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Biology"}, "month": "6", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0004984a4e99407ead65792007c4abe9", "created_date": "2020-06-21T12:24:34Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:21:10Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1660-3397", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3390/md16060207", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "16", "number": "6", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/marinedrugs/about"}], "issns": ["1660-3397"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Marine Drugs"}, "month": "6", "keywords": ["Zoanthidea", "holo-transcriptome", "cnidarian transcriptome", "marine enzyme", "marine biocatalyst", "marine biotechnology", "pharmaceutical biotechnology"], "year": "2018", "start_page": "207", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Northeast Biotechnology Network (RENORBIO), Post-Graduation Program in Biotechnology, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza 60440-900, Brazil", "name": "Jean-\u00c9tienne R.

Their use commonly focuses on changes in population abundance and individual sizes in response to environmental change. These numerical and demographic shifts likely have behavioral and physiological mechanistic drivers that, if understood, could provide additional insights into the use of these species as bioindicators of habitat health. The Atlantic ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata, is a global bioindicator species of human disturbance on sandy shores. Individual size and population abundance of O.\u00a0quadrata decline dramatically at sites with human disturbance, and the causes of this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual and population\u2010level changes at disturbed sites reflect changes in burrowing behavior and energetics. Specifically, we examine whether or not the burrowing behavior (e.g., burrow fidelity and longevity) of O.\u00a0quadrata changes because of human disturbance. We also examine energy required for burrowing by O.\u00a0quadrata across different levels of human disturbance. We show that O.\u00a0quadrata have the highest burrow fidelity and longevity at sites with low level of human impact, and weakest burrow fidelity and longevity at pristine sites. O.\u00a0quadrata reduce the burrowing energy allocation by manipulating the burrow dimension and increasing the burrow longevity even under low levels of human disturbance. Overall, this study shows that human disturbances not only change the behavior of organisms, but also shift energetic balance. Our results support the use of a bioenergetic approach to better understand how human disturbances influence natural populations, and the specific use of this approach with this bioindicator species.", "title": "Burrowing behavior and burrowing energetics of a bioindicator under human disturbance", "journal": {"volume": "9", "number": "24", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2045-7758/homepage/open_access_license_and_copyright.htm"}], "issns": ["2045-7758"], "publisher": "Wiley", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Ecology and Evolution"}, "month": "12", "start_page": "14205"}, "id": "000588ab77ca46dc825f09fa9788a96c", "created_date": "2020-01-10T15:39:54Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:19:35Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2211-1247", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.071", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "637", "keywords": ["colorectal cancer", "obesity", "weight loss", "DNA methylation", "gene expression", "cellular metabolism", "signal transduction"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Epigenetics and Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA", "name": "Ruifang Li"}, {"affiliation": "Integrative Bioinformatics, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA", "name": "Sara A.

The role of LEF1 in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly known. We investigated LEF1 expression in HCC and its interactions with epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators (e.g., Snail, Slug, Twist) and stemness genes (e.g., octamer\u2010binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], sex determining region Y\u2010box 2 [Sox2], Nanog homeobox [Nanog]). Microarray analysis was performed on resected tumor samples from patients with HCC with or without postoperative recurrence. LEF1 expression was associated with postoperative recurrence as validated by immunohistochemical staining in another HCC cohort. Among 74 patients, 44 displayed a relatively high percentage of LEF1 staining (>30% of HCC cells), which was associated with a reduced recurrence\u2010free interval (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, a high percentage of LEF1 staining was significantly associated with low albumin level (P = 0.035), Twist overexpression (P = 0.018), Snail overexpression (P = 0.064), co\u2010expression of Twist and Snail (P = 0.054), and multinodular tumors (P = 0.025). Down\u2010regulation of LEF1 by short hairpin RNA decreased tumor sphere formation, soft agar colony formation, and transwell invasiveness of HCC cell lines Mahlavu and PLC. Xenotransplant and tail vein injection experiments revealed that LEF1 down\u2010regulation in Mahlavu reduced tumor size and metastasis. LEF1 up\u2010regulation in Huh7 increased sphere formation, soft agar colony formation, and transwell invasiveness. LEF1 was shown to physically interact with and transcriptionally activate promoter regions of Oct4, Snail, Slug, and Twist. Furthermore, Oct4, Snail, and Twist transactivated LEF1 to form a regulatory positive\u2010feedback loop.

Telomere biology disorders encompass a growing spectrum of conditions caused by rare pathogenic germline variants in genes encoding essential aspects of telomere function. Dyskeratosis congenita, a disorder at the severe end of this spectrum, typically presents in childhood with the classic triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, accompanied by a very high risk of bone marrow failure, cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, and other medical problems. In contrast, the less severe end of the telomere biology disorder spectrum consists of middle-age or older adults with just one feature typically seen in dyskeratosis congenita, such as pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. In the common disease realm, large-scale molecular epidemiology studies have discovered novel associations between illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and mental health, and both telomere length and common genetic variants in telomere biology genes. This review highlights recent findings of telomere biology in human disease from both the rare and common disease perspectives.

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.", "title": "In vitro and in vivo studies identify important features of dengue virus pr-E protein interactions."}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00080043ce574975bec4229d0d61cc22", "created_date": "2016-06-14T15:59:23Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:13:21Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s13073-020-00749-y", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1756-994X", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "16", "keywords": ["Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome", "Epigenetics", "Aging", "Lamina-associated domains (LADs)", "DNA methylation", "Chromatin accessibility"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "R", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine"}, {"code": "QH426-470", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Genetics"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center", "name": "Florian K\u00f6hler"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center", "name": "Felix Bormann"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center", "name": "G\u00fcnter Raddatz"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center", "name": "Julian Gutekunst"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University (ZMBH)", "name": "Samuel Corless"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center", "name": "Tanja Musch"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg", "name": "Anke S.

Cells from affected individuals express a mutant version of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A (termed progerin) and have previously been shown to exhibit prominent histone modification changes. Methods Here, we analyze the possibility that epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) is involved in the molecular pathology of HGPS. To do so, we studied chromatin accessibility (Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-see/-seq), DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips), and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of nine primary HGPS fibroblast cell lines and six additional controls, two parental and four age-matched healthy fibroblast cell lines. Results Our ATAC-see/-seq data demonstrate that primary dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients exhibit chromatin accessibility changes that are enriched in LADs. Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip profiling further reveals that DNA methylation alterations observed in HGPS fibroblasts are similarly enriched in LADs and different from those occurring during healthy aging and Werner syndrome (WS), another premature aging disease. Moreover, HGPS patients can be stratified into two different subgroups according to their DNA methylation profiles. Finally, we show that the epigenetic deregulation of LADs is associated with HGPS-specific gene expression changes. Conclusions Taken together, our results strongly implicate epigenetic deregulation of LADs as an important and previously unrecognized feature of HGPS, which contributes to disease-specific gene expression. Therefore, they not only add a new layer to the study of epigenetic changes in the progeroid syndrome, but also advance our understanding of the disease\u2019s pathology at the cellular level.", "title": "Epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome", "journal": {"volume": "12", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["1756-994X"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Genome Medicine"}, "month": "5", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00088c8a4a8149b6ae3e7d7c5020a4fa", "created_date": "2020-05-31T12:08:45Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:20:18Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2235-2988", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fcimb.2014.00147", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "4", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/cellular-and-infection-microbiology#about"}], "issns": ["2235-2988"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["Symbiosis", "epigenetics", "non-coding RNA", "microbiota", "neurodevelopment", "microbiome"], "year": "2014", "subject": [{"code": "QR1-502", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Microbiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Roman M Stilling"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Roman M Stilling"}, {"affiliation": "Vanderbilt University", "name": "Seth R Bordenstein"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Timothy G Dinan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Timothy G Dinan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "John F Cryan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "John F Cryan"}], "link": [{"content_type": "HTML", "type": "fulltext", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fcimb.2014.00147/full"}], "abstract": "The tight association of the human body with trillions of colonizing microbes that we observe today is the result of a long evolutionary history.

Piglets inoculated with CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health, along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus, developed subclinical to mild diarrhea. In contrast, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, astasia, and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the S gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent Japanese PEDV isolate OKN-1/JPN/2013. Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the S1 subunit of the S protein is an important determinant of PEDV virulence, and advance development of new vaccine candidate.", "title": "S1 Subunit of Spike Protein from a Current Highly Virulent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Is an Important Determinant of Virulence in Piglets"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-08-31T06:51:29Z", "id": "0009ae398c4c41a68f662a17347d0625"}, {"last_updated": "2021-01-13T14:33:51Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2500-0462", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2500-3259", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "797", "keywords": ["miniature pigs", "atomic absorption spectroscopy", "sodium", "potassium", "tissue samples"], "year": "2017", "subject": [{"code": "QH426-470", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Genetics"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Novosibirsk State University; Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS.", "name": "A.

However, despite the widespread interest in this breed of animals, the distribution of water and electrolytes in the tissues of miniature pigs remains poorly understood, which led us to conduct this study. The distribution of sodium, potassium cations and water in skeletal muscles, myocardium, smooth muscle elements of the vascular system, liver and skin of mini-pigs differing in gender and behavioral response to humans has been studied. Quantitative determination of sodium and potassium cations was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that skeletal and smooth muscles differ in electrolyte content. The impact of behavioral response to humans on the electrolyte level in skeletal muscle was detected. The data are confirmed by two-factor dispersion analysis. The accumulation of water in muscle samples of \u201ctame\u201d males as compared with cowardly animals was shown. The impact of different behavioral types on the amount of sodium in the skin was revealed. The impact of the gender of animals or the type of behavior on the sodium level in the liver was not detected. However, a significant amount of potassium was found in the liver as compared with sodium level, which is possibly associated with a high density of cellular elements. The gender and behavioral type of animals did not have an impact on the distribution of potassium and the mass fraction of water in the skin and liver. Some differences in the distribution of the main extracellular and intracellular sectors\u2019 cations were revealed, and so was the dependence of the electrolyte content on the functional characteristics of the tissues.

There has been no information on the status of co-infections of tuberculosis and parasitosis in Oromia Zone of Amhara Region and South Wollo, Ethiopia. Hence, this study primarily focuses on determining the status of tuberculosis and parasitosis co-infections and associated factors. Methods The study was conducted in Oromia Special Zone of the Amhara Regional State and South Wollo Zone, northeastern Ethiopia from April 2015 to January 2017. Tuberculosis cases confirmed by health personnel at the health institutions were the source of the study sample. In a cross-sectional study 384 smear positive pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases were recruited. Faecal specimens provided by the study participants were examined for parasitic co-infections using direct saline microscopic test, Kato-Katz and concentration techniques. Nutritional status was determined using body mass index and mid-upper arm circumferences. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and Pearson chi-square. Results Tuberculosis and parasitosis co-infection prevalence was 10.8%, and the proportion of intestinal helminths accounted for 9.7% while intestinal protozoa accounted for 1.9%. Cases with single parasitic infection was 89.3% among co-infected individuals. Co-infection of both disease was not significantly associated with gender and age (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The prevalence of undernutrition was 58.6% as determined using body mass index and 73.0% as determined using mid-upper arm circumference with no significant association with gender. Among all forms of tuberculosis cases (384) screened for the study, the bacterial positivity was relatively more common in males (55.5%) than females (44.5%). Tuberculosis lymphadenitis was found to be the most prevalent (85.9%) form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis with cervical adenopathy (75.3%) being the commonly existing disease. Conclusions The rate of helminthic co-infection is predominantly high than that of intestinal protozoa. Single parasitic co-infection was more common than double or multiple co-infections. Both body mass index and mid-upper arm circumference anthropometric parameters revealed greater risk of undernutrition in tuberculosis patients. Thus, screening and prompt treatment of parasites in tuberculosis patients and a support of nutritional supplementation for malnourished tuberculosis patients should be further studied which might enhance the disease treatment and minimize the risk of its complexity.", "title": "High helminthic co-infection in tuberculosis patients with undernutritional status in northeastern Ethiopia", "journal": {"volume": "8", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license"}], "issns": ["2095-5162", "2049-9957"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Infectious Diseases of Poverty"}, "month": "10", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "000af0de99cb4b92946687c1cd02488f", "created_date": "2019-10-20T16:20:34Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:17:38Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/microorganisms8081217", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-2607", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "8", "number": "1217", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms/about"}], "issns": ["2076-2607"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Microorganisms"}, "month": "08", "keywords": ["genetic", "infection", "inflammation", "pathogenesis"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "1217", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland", "name": "Jacek Czepiel"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Krakow, Poland", "name": "Gra\u017cyna Biesiada"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Medical Genomics OMICRON, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-034 Krakow, Poland", "name": "Ewelina Pitera"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Medical Genomics OMICRON, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-034 Krakow, Poland", "name": "Pawe\u0142  P.

Among microbial symbionts, integrating genetic species delimitation methods with trait data that could indicate reproductive isolation, such as host specificity data, has rarely been used despite its potential to inform species limits. Here we test the ability of an integrative approach combining genetic and host specificity data to delimit species within the avian malaria parasite genus Leucocytozoon in central Alaska. Results We sequenced seven nuclear loci for 69 Leucocytozoon samples and used multiple species delimitation methods (GMYC and BPP models), tested for differences in host infection patterns among putative species based on 406 individual infections, and characterized parasite morphology. We found that cryptic morphology has masked a highly diverse Leucocytozoon assemblage, with most species delimitation methods recovering support for at least 21 separate species that occur sympatrically and have divergent host infection patterns. Reproductive isolation among putative species appears to have evolved despite low mtDNA divergence, and in one instance two Leucocytozoon cytb haplotypes that differed by a single base pair (~\u20090.2% divergence) were supported as separate species. However, there was no consistent association between mtDNA divergence and species limits. Among cytb haplotypes that differed by one to three base pairs we observed idiosyncratic patterns of nuclear and ecological divergence, with cytb haplotype pairs found to be either conspecific, reproductively isolated with no divergence in host specificity, or reproductively isolated with divergent patterns of host specialization. Conclusion Integrating multi-locus genetic species delimitation methods and non-traditional ecological data types such as host specificity provide a novel view of the diversity of avian malaria parasites that has been missed previously using morphology and mtDNA barcodes. Species delimitation methods show that Leucocytozoon is highly species-rich in Alaska, and the genus is likely to harbor extraordinary species-level diversity worldwide.

Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data.

SelenoN knockout (KO) mouse limb muscles, however, are protected from the disease, and display no major alterations in muscle histology or contractile properties. Interestingly, we find that the highly active diaphragm muscle shows impaired force production, in line with the human phenotype. In addition, after repeated stimulation with a protocol which induces muscle fatigue, also hind limb muscles show altered relaxation times. Mechanistically, muscle SELENON loss alters activity-dependent calcium handling selectively impinging on the Ca2+ uptake of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and elicits an ER stress response, including the expression of the maladaptive CHOP-induced ERO1. In SELENON-devoid models, ERO1 shifts ER redox to a more oxidised poise, and further affects Ca2+ uptake. Importantly, CHOP ablation in SelenoN KO mice completely prevents diaphragm dysfunction, the prolonged limb muscle relaxation after fatigue, and restores Ca2+ uptake by attenuating the induction of ERO1. These findings suggest that SELENON is part of an ER stress-dependent antioxidant response and that the CHOP/ERO1 branch of the ER stress response is a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying SELENON-related myopathies.

The primary reason is that there is presently no effective treatment option, especially for radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome. This syndrome results from disruption of mucosal barrier integrity leading to severe dehydration, blood loss, and sepsis. In this study, we tested whether extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) could reduce radiation-related mucosal barrier damage and reduce radiation-induced animal mortality. Methods Human MSC-derived extracellular vesicles were intravenously administered to NUDE mice, 3, 24, and 48\u2009h after lethal whole-body irradiation (10\u2009Gy). Integrity of the small intestine epithelial barrier was assessed by morphologic analysis, immunostaining for tight junction protein (claudin-3), and in vivo permeability to 4\u2009kDa FITC-labeled dextran. Renewal of the small intestinal epithelium was determined by quantifying epithelial cell apoptosis (TUNEL staining) and proliferation (Ki67 immunostaining). Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test. Statistical analyses of mouse survival were performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods. Results We demonstrated that MSC-derived extracellular vesicle treatment reduced by 85% the instantaneous mortality risk in mice subjected to 10\u2009Gy whole-body irradiation and so increased their survival time. This effect could be attributed to the efficacy of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles in reducing mucosal barrier disruption. We showed that the MSC-derived extracellular vesicles improved the renewal of the small intestinal epithelium by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of the epithelial crypt cells. The MSC-derived extracellular vesicles also reduced radiation-induced mucosal permeability as evidenced by the preservation of claudin-3 immunostaining at the tight junctions of the epithelium. Conclusions MSC-derived extracellular vesicles promote epithelial repair and regeneration and preserve structural integrity of the intestinal epithelium in mice exposed to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Our results suggest that the administration of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles could be an effective therapy for limiting acute radiation syndrome.", "title": "Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells mitigate intestinal toxicity in a mouse model of acute radiation syndrome", "journal": {"volume": "11", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/about /license "}], "issns": ["1757-6512"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Stem Cell Research & Therapy"}, "month": "8", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "000c6eb1acac4951a703805a5bdf6f71", "created_date": "2020-08-30T12:09:12Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:12:12Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/1471-2156-7-41", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1471-2156", "type": "pissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "7", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["1471-2156"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Genetics"}, "month": "7", "year": "2006", "start_page": "41", "subject": [{"code": "QH426-470", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Genetics"}], "author": [{"name": "Norwood Thomas H"}, {"name": "Luo Ping"}, {"name": "Varadarajan Kartik R"}, {"name": "Gartler Stanley M"}, {"name": "Canfield Theresa K"}, {"name": "Hansen R Scott"}], "link": [{"type": "fulltext", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/41"}], "abstract": "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is that aspect of mammalian dosage compensation that brings about equivalence of X-linked gene expression between females and males by inactivating one of the two X chromosomes (Xi) in normal female cells, leaving them with a single active X (Xa) as in male cells.

However, objective and scalable methods for assessment of motor functioning in schizophrenia are lacking. Advancements in machine learning-based digital tools have allowed for automated and remote \u201cdigital phenotyping\u201d of disease symptomatology. Here, we assess the performance of a computer vision-based assessment of motor functioning as a characteristic of schizophrenia using video data collected remotely through smartphones. Methods: Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and 9 healthy controls were asked to remotely participate in smartphone-based assessments daily for 14 days. Video recorded from the smartphone front-facing camera during these assessments was used to quantify the Euclidean distance of head movement between frames through a pretrained computer vision model. The ability of head movement measurements to distinguish between patients and healthy controls as well as their relationship to schizophrenia symptom severity as measured through traditional clinical scores was assessed. Results: The rate of head movement in participants with schizophrenia (1.48 mm/frame) and those without differed significantly (2.50 mm/frame; p = 0.01), and a logistic regression demonstrated that head movement was a significant predictor of schizophrenia diagnosis (p = 0.02). Linear regression between head movement and clinical scores of schizophrenia showed that head movement has a negative relationship with schizophrenia symptom severity (p = 0.04), primarily with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Conclusions: Remote, smartphone-based assessments were able to capture meaningful visual behavior for computer vision-based objective measurement of head movement. The measurements of head movement acquired were able to accurately classify schizophrenia diagnosis and quantify symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia.", "title": "Computer Vision-Based Assessment of Motor Functioning in Schizophrenia: Use of Smartphones for Remote Measurement of Schizophrenia Symptomatology", "journal": {"volume": "5", "number": "1", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2504-110X"], "publisher": "Karger Publishers", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Digital Biomarkers"}, "month": "1", "start_page": "29"}, "created_date": "2021-01-21T15:34:29Z", "id": "000cc142ffca48208e218b09839f31f9"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:40:05Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2090-2247", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2090-2255", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1155/2012/493894", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2012", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bri/guidelines/"}], "issns": ["2090-2247", "2090-2255"], "publisher": "Hindawi Limited", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Biochemistry Research International"}, "year": "2012", "subject": [{"code": "QD415-436", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biochemistry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Responses to Xenobiotics, Unit of Functional and Adaptive Biology (BFA),  CNRS EAC 4413, University of Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, 75013 Paris, France", "name": "Karine Andreau"}, {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Responses to Xenobiotics, Unit of Functional and Adaptive Biology (BFA),  CNRS EAC 4413, University of Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, 75013 Paris, France", "name": "Melanie Leroux"}, {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Responses to Xenobiotics, Unit of Functional and Adaptive Biology (BFA),  CNRS EAC 4413, University of Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, 75013 Paris, France", "name": "Aida Bouharrour"}], "link": [{"type": "fulltext", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/493894"}], "abstract": "Air pollution as one of the ravages of our modern societies is primarily linked to urban centers, industrial activities, or road traffic.

The genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is expected to lead to a better understanding of M. tuberculosis transmission in Tehran, the most populated city of Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 2300 clinical specimens were obtained from TB suspected patients who were referred to a TB center in Tehran from Jan 2014 to Dec 2016. Identification was performed using both conventional and molecular methods. The presence of resistance to rifampicin was examined by the GeneXpert MTB/RIF. The standard 15-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing method was applied to genotype of clinical isolates. Results: Of 2300 specimens, 80 isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis by using biochemical and molecular tests. Of 80 M. tuberculosis isolates, 76 (95%) had unique genotypic profiles and 4 (5%) shared a profile with one or more other strains. Based on single loci variation (SLV) 4 clonal complexes were observed. NEW-1 was found to be the most predominant lineage (22.5%) followed by West African (1.25%), Central Asian (CAS)/Delhi (1.25%), Bovis (1.25%), H37Rv (1.25%) and multiple matches (1.25%).

Conclusions: Our study findings show that there was considerable genotypic diversity among M. tuberculosis isolates in Tehran.

The tribe is endemic to southern Africa, confined chiefly to the southwestern South Africa, home of two biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region and Succulent Karoo). The monospecific Chamira (C. circaeoides), the only crucifer species with persistent cotyledons, is traditionally retrieved as the closest relative of Heliophileae. Our transcriptome analysis revealed a whole-genome duplication (WGD) \u223c26.15\u201329.20 million years ago, presumably preceding the Chamira/Heliophila split. The WGD was then followed by genome-wide diploidization, species radiations, and cladogenesis in Heliophila. The expanded phylogeny based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) uncovered four major infrageneric clades (A\u2013D) in Heliophila and corroborated the sister relationship between Chamira and Heliophila. Herein, we analyzed how the diploidization process impacted the evolution of repetitive sequences through low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 15 Heliophila species, representing the four clades, and Chamira. Despite the firmly established infrageneric cladogenesis and different ecological life histories (four perennials vs. 11 annual species), repeatome analysis showed overall comparable evolution of genome sizes (288\u2013484 Mb) and repeat content (25.04\u201338.90%) across Heliophila species and clades. Among Heliophila species, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were the predominant components of the analyzed genomes (11.51\u201322.42%), whereas tandem repeats had lower abundances (1.03\u201312.10%). In Chamira, the tandem repeat content (17.92%, 16 diverse tandem repeats) equals the abundance of LTR retrotransposons (16.69%). Among the 108 tandem repeats identified in Heliophila, only 16 repeats were found to be shared among two or more species; no tandem repeats were shared by Chamira and Heliophila genomes. Six \u201crelic\u201d tandem repeats were shared between any two different Heliophila clades by a common descent. Four and six clade-specific repeats shared among clade A and C species, respectively, support the monophyly of these two clades. Three repeats shared by all clade A species corroborate the recent diversification of this clade revealed by plastome-based molecular dating.

In this review, we describe some of the behavioral paradigms used to assess different types of social behavior, such as social interaction, social memory, aggressive behavior and sexual behavior. We then focus on the effects of pharmacological modulation of mGluR1-8 on these types of social behavior. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates beneficial effects of selective ligands of specific mGluRs in ameliorating innate or pharmacologically-induced deficits in social interaction and social memory as well as in reducing aggression in rodents.

However, the energy-rich trophic subsidy that aquaculture provides may create cascades with influences over broader spatial scales. In a fjord region with intensive fish farming, we tested whether an ecosystem engineer, the white urchin Gracilechinus acutus, was more abundant at aquaculture sites than control sites. Further, we tested whether diets influenced by aquaculture waste altered reproductive outputs compared with natural diets. Urchins formed barrens at aquaculture sites where they were 10 times more abundant (38 urchins m-2) than at control sites (4 urchins m-2). Urchins were on average 15 mm larger at control sites. In the laboratory, urchins fed aquafeed diets had 3 times larger gonad indices than urchins fed a natural diet. However, their reproduction was compromised. Eggs from females fed an aquafeed diet had 13% lower fertilisation success and 30% lower larval survival rates at 10 d compared with females fed a natural diet. A reproductive output model showed that enhanced numbers of 10 d old larvae produced by the dense aquaculture-associated aggregations of G. acutus will supersede any detrimental effects on reproduction, with larval outputs from aquaculture sites being on average 5 times greater than control sites. The results show that aquaculture waste can act as a trophic subsidy in fjord ecosystems, stimulating aggregations of urchins and promoting the formation of urchin barrens. Where finfish aquaculture is concentrated, combined effects on the wider environment may produce ecosystem-level consequences.", "title": "Aquaculture-derived trophic subsidy boosts populations of an ecosystem engineer"}, "id": "000e4e7761a14fb5beb8b50ac4012d7d", "created_date": "2020-06-12T19:50:34Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T21:10:34Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1422-0067", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3390/ijms18050947", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "18", "number": "5", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section"}], "issns": ["1422-0067", "1661-6596"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences"}, "month": "4", "keywords": ["galectin-3", "degenerative aortic stenosis", "prognostic value", "mortality", "invasive treatment", "balloon aortic valvuloplasty"], "year": "2017", "start_page": "947", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}, {"code": "QD1-999", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Chemistry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Second Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Beata Bobrowska"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital, 15C Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Ewa Wieczorek-Surdacka"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Coronary Artery Disease and Heart Failure, John Paul II Hospital, 80 Pr\u0105dnicka Street, 31-202 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Olga Kruszelnicka"}, {"affiliation": "Second Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Bernadeta Chyrchel"}, {"affiliation": "Second Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Andrzej Surdacki"}, {"affiliation": "Second Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland", "name": "Dariusz Dudek"}], "link": [{"content_type": "pdf", "type": "fulltext", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/5/947"}], "abstract": "Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectin, has been implicated in myocardial fibrosis, development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and transition from compensated LV hypertrophy to overt heart failure (HF), being a novel prognostic marker in HF. Risk stratification is crucial for the choice of the optimal therapy in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), affecting elderly subjects with coexistent diseases. Our aim was to assess correlates and prognostic value of circulating Gal-3 in real-world patients with degenerative AS referred for invasive treatment. Gal-3 levels were measured at admission in 80 consecutive patients with symptomatic degenerative AS (mean age: 79 \u00b1 8 years; aortic valve area (AVA) index: 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 cm2/m2). The therapeutic strategy was chosen following a dedicated multidisciplinary team-oriented approach, including surgical valve replacement (n = 11), transcatheter valve implantation (n = 19), balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) (n = 25) and optimal medical therapy (n = 25). Besides routine echocardiographic indices, valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva), an index of global LV afterload, was computed. There were 22 deaths over a median follow-up of 523 days. Baseline Gal-3 correlated negatively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r = \u22120.61, p &lt; 0.001) and was unrelated to age, symptomatic status, AVA index, LV ejection fraction, LV mass index or Zva. For the study group as a whole, Gal-3 tended to predict mortality (Gal-3 &gt;17.8 vs. Gal-3 &lt;17.8 ng/mL; hazard ratio (HR): 2.03 (95% confidence interval, 0.88\u20134.69), p = 0.09), which was abolished upon adjustment for eGFR (HR: 1.70 (0.61\u20134.73), p = 0.3). However, in post-BAV patients multivariate-adjusted pre-procedural Gal-3 was associated with worse survival (HR: 7.41 (1.52\u201336.1), p = 0.01) regardless of eGFR. In conclusion, the inverse eGFR\u2013Gal-3 relationship underlies a weak association between Gal-3 and adverse outcome in patients with degenerative AS referred for invasive therapy irrespective of type of treatment employed.

Recently, de-blurring methods have been performed by neural network methods, such as the generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a powerful generative network. Among many different types of GAN, the proposed method is performed using the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGANGP). Since edge information is the most important factor in an image, the style loss function is applied to represent the perceptual information of the edge in order to preserve small edge information and capture its perceptual similarity. As a result, the proposed method improves the similarity between sharp and blurred images by minimizing the Wasserstein distance, and it captures well the perceptual similarity using the style loss function, considering the correlation of features in the convolutional neural network (CNN). To confirm the performance of the proposed method, three experiments are conducted using two datasets: the GOPRO Large and Kohler dataset. The optimal solutions are found by changing the parameter values experimentally. Consequently, the experiments depict that the proposed method achieves 0.98 higher performance in structural similarity (SSIM) and outperforms other de-blurring methods in the case of both datasets.", "title": "Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Based De-Blurring Using Perceptual Similarity"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-06-10T07:00:54Z", "id": "000f0dbb7912498e83c66a7c56258d8b"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:54:35Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s12870-019-1970-0", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1471-2229", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "14", "keywords": ["Dormancy", "Hormone", "Inhibitor", "iTRAQ", "RNA-seq", "Western blot"], "year": "2019", "subject": [{"code": "QK1-989", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Botany"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Yong Wang"}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Yin Min Htwe"}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Jing Li"}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Peng Shi"}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Dapeng Zhang"}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Oil Crops Biology, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences", "name": "Zhihao Zhao"}, {"affiliation": "Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR)", "name": "Leonard Osayande Ihase"}], "link": [{"content_type": "HTML", "type": "fulltext", "url": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-019-1970-0"}], "abstract": "Abstract Background Heat treatment is widely used to break dormancy for seed germination and phytohormones could be deeply involved. However, effect of heat treatment on phytohormone related genes/proteins/metabolites and possible relationship with dormancy release remains unclear in oil palm. In this study, oil palm seeds were heat-treated at 39\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009days according to the method for commercial production. The embryos of seeds during heat treatment (0 d, 15 d, 30 d, 45 d and 60 d) and of germinated seeds (70 d and 75 d) were selected to discover the mechanisms involved in oil palm seed germination. RNA-seq and iTRAQ were applied to investigate DEGs and DEPs related to seed germination; qPCR and western blot were used as validation accordingly; endogenous phytohormones were determined by LC-MS/MS and exogenous phytohormones were also applied to validate their effects on seed germination. Results RNA-seq results showed that plant hormone signal transduction was one of the most important pathways and eight phytohormones involved, while six of them (ABA, GA, ET, CTK, IAA and JA) were also identified by iTRAQ. Both RNA-seq and iTRAQ results showed that the expression of ABA decreased after heat treatment, which was further validated by qPCR and western blot. Furthermore, changes in endogenous phytohormones showed that ABA decreased rapidly to about 9% of the control at 30 d and then stayed at very low levels until germination; GA and CTK increased while IAA was not affected by heat treatment. Besides, exogenous ABA treatments (10, 100, 1000\u2009mg/L) showed that the germination rate decreased to 63, 42 and 16% of the control, respectively, suggesting that ABA suppress seed germination and the inhibition effect increase with higher concentration; while the germination rates of exogenous GA and IAA treatments barely changed among different concentrations. Conclusions Phytohormones are deeply involved in oil palm seed germination and ABA acts as an inhibitor. Heat treatment can eliminate endogenous ABA and break dormancy, while GA and CTK may also involve in dormancy release. At least 30\u2009days of heat treatment might be necessary.

Infrared spectroscopy, studies on the effects of pH and temperature, and kinetics and isotherm modelling are carried out to evaluate the biosorption. The infrared spectroscopy shows that the primary biosorption sites on the biosorbents are carboxylate groups. In addition, a higher pH and higher temperatures promote biosorption while a decline in biosorption ability is observed for C. krusei at 50\u2009\u00b0C. The kinetics study shows that C. krusei, CaAlg and immobilized C. krusei (MCaAlg) conform with good correlation to pseudo-second order kinetics.

They are cytotoxic cells involved in the rejection reaction between contacting, genetically incompatible colonies. Upon the recognition of foreign substances, they degranulate and release their content, which contribute to the cell death along the contact borders. A major role in MCrelated cytotoxicity is exerted by the enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) that converts polyphenol substrata to quinones which, then, polymerize to form melanins. During this reaction, reactive oxygen species are formed which are the cause of MC-related cytotoxicity. Here, we carried out new analyses to investigate further the nature of MC content and its role in cytotoxicity. Results confirm that PO is located inside MC vacuoles together with arylsulfatase, iron and polyphenols/quinones, the latter probably representing ready-to-use cytotoxic molecules, deriving from the oxidation of DOPAcontaining proteins. In addition, small DOPA-containing peptides, called tunichromes, are also present inside MCs. MC degranulation and PO-mediated cytotoxicity are prevented by secretion inhibitors and by H89 and calphostin C. The observation that PO activity is always detectable in MCs in the absence of protease treatment, and its inhibition by sulfites and sulfates, suggest a non-classical pathway of PO modulation in botryllid ascidians.\n", "title": "Insights on cytotoxic cells of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri"}, "id": "000fb928550c4b2d8f2f786e9c18a748", "created_date": "2020-11-18T10:12:02Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:00:26Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2090-2247", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2090-2255", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1155/2012/454796", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2012", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bri/guidelines/"}], "issns": ["2090-2247", "2090-2255"], "publisher": "Hindawi Limited", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Biochemistry Research International"}, "year": "2012", "subject": [{"code": "QD415-436", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biochemistry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Laboratory of Chromatin Structure and Functions, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology RAS, Moscow 119991, Russia", "name": "Dmitry Karpov"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biology, Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, 32000 Haifa, Israel", "name": "Michael H.

However, to date, most of the studies on the ecological consequences of antagonistic interactions between invasive plants and the resident biota focused only on pairwise interactions. A full understanding of invasion dynamics requires studies that test the effects of multiple antagonists on fitness of invasive plants and co\u2010occurring native plants. Here, we used an invasive plant Mikania micrantha, a co\u2010occurring native plant Coix lacryma\u2010jobi, and a native holoparasitic plant Cuscuta campestris to test whether parasitism on M.\u00a0micrantha interacts with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of the co\u2010occurring native plant. In a factorial setup, M.\u00a0micrantha and C.\u00a0lacryma\u2010jobi were grown together in pots in the presence versus absence of parasitism on M.\u00a0micrantha by C.\u00a0campestris and in the presence versus absence of full complements of soil bacteria and fungi. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. Findings show that heavy parasitism by C.\u00a0campestris caused the greatest reduction in M.\u00a0micrantha biomass when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed. In contrast, the co\u2010occurring native plant C.\u00a0lacryma\u2010jobi experienced the greatest increase in biomass when grown with heavily parasitized M.\u00a0micrantha and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria.

Although the standard approach of pharmacological treatments is to directly suppress the hyperexcitability through reducing excitation or enhancing inhibition, different techniques for stimulating brain activity are often used to treat refractory neurological conditions. However, it is unclear why stimulating brain activity would be effective for controlling hyperexcitability. Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis in these disorders exhibits a transition from an initial activity loss after acute injury or progressive neurodegeneration to subsequent development of hyperexcitability. This process mimics homeostatic activity regulation and may contribute to developing network hyperexcitability that underlies neurological symptoms. This hypothesis also predicts that stimulating brain activity should be effective in reducing hyperexcitability due to homeostatic activity regulation and in relieving symptoms. Here we review current evidence of homeostatic plasticity in the development of hyperexcitability in some neurological diseases and the effects of brain stimulation. The homeostatic plasticity hypothesis may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neurological diseases and may guide the use of brain stimulation techniques for treating them.", "title": "Homeostatic activity regulation as a mechanism underlying the effect of brain stimulation", "journal": {"volume": "5", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["2332-8886"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Bioelectronic Medicine"}, "month": "9", "start_page": "1"}, "id": "0010de5172194ac1b54d0aac5b1c9817", "created_date": "2019-09-29T12:26:50Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:40:29Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2353-074X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.5586/am.1999.021", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "327", "keywords": ["Mycelium", "Laetiporus sulphureus", "lectin", "mycelial cultures"], "year": "2014", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Jagiellonian University", "name": "Gra\u017cyna Ko\u0144ska"}, {"affiliation": "University d'Auvergen", "name": "Jean Guillot"}, {"affiliation": "Jagiellonian University", "name": "Stanis\u0142aw Kohlm\u00fcnzer"}, {"affiliation": "University d'Auvergen", "name": "Mireille Damez"}, {"affiliation": "Jagiellonian University", "name": "Kinga Rakoczy"}], "link": [{"content_type": "html", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/am/article/view/3751"}], "abstract": "This study proved the presence of lectin in mycelial cultures of Laetiporus sulphureus.

The synthesized hierarchical polymer brushes bearing peptide motifs were characterized in detail using various surface sensitive physicochemical methods. The hierarchical brushes presenting the RGD sequences provided excellent cell adhesion properties and at the same time remained resistant to fouling from blood plasma. The synthesis of anti-fouling hierarchical brushes bearing 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> nmol/cm<sup>2 </sup>RGD biomimetic sequences has been adapted for the surface modification of commercially available grafts of woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers.

This study aimed to investigate whether the nonselective A2 adenosine receptor agonist NECA induces cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury via glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Methods and Results. H9c2 cells were exposed to H2O2 for 20 minutes. NECA significantly prevented H2O2-induced TMRE fluorescence reduction, indicating that NECA inhibited the mPTP opening. NECA blocked H2O2-induced GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation and GRP94 expression. NECA increased GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation and decreased GRP94 expression, which were prevented by both ERS inductor 2-DG and PKG inhibitor KT5823, suggesting that NECA may induce cardioprotection through GSK-3\u03b2 and cGMP/PKG via ERS. In isolated rat hearts, both NECA and the ERS inhibitor TUDCA decreased myocardial infarction, increased GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, and reversed GRP94 expression at reperfusion, suggesting that NECA protected the heart by inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 and ERS. Transmission electron microscopy showed that NECA and TUDCA reduced mitochondrial swelling and endoplasmic reticulum expansion, further supporting that NECA protected the heart by preventing the mPTP opening and ERS. Conclusion. These data suggest that NECA prevents the mPTP opening through inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2 via ERS inhibition.

RNA interference mediated by short interfering RNAs and microRNAs (miRNA), is a widespread anti-viral defence strategy. Importantly, viruses also encode their own miRNAs. In recent times miRNAs were identified as key players in host-virus interaction. Furthermore, viruses were shown to exploit the host miRNA networks to suite their own need. The complex cross-talk between host and viral miRNAs and their cellular and viral targets forms the environment for viral pathogenesis. Apart from protein-coding mRNAs, non-coding RNAs may also be targeted by host or viral miRNAs in virus infected cells, and viruses can exploit the host miRNA mediated gene regulatory network via the competing endogenous RNA effect. A recent report showed that viral U-rich non-coding RNAs called HSUR, expressed in primate virus herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) infected T cells, were able to bind to three host miRNAs, causing significant alteration in cellular level for one of the miRNAs. We have predicted protein coding and non protein-coding targets for viral and human miRNAs in virus infected cells. We identified viral miRNA targets within host non-coding RNA loci from AGO interacting regions in three different virus infected cells. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the genes comprising the ceRNA networks in the virus infected cells revealed enrichment of key cellular signalling pathways related to cell fate decisions  and gene transcription, like Notch and Wnt signalling pathways, as well as pathways related to viral entry, replication and virulence. We identified a vast number of non-coding transcripts playing as potential ceRNAs to the immune response associated genes; e.g. APOBEC family genes, in some virus infected cells.

Methods: Exosomes were isolated from ADSCs (ADSC-EXOs) or from ADSCs in which corin gene expression was silenced by siRNA (siCorin). For in\u00a0vivo studies, rats with streptozotocin-induced DM were intravenously injected with ADSC-EXOs or siCorin-ADSC-EXOs. Two weeks later, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured to assess erectile function, and penile tissues were harvested for further evaluation of levels of inflammatory factors and expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). We also evaluated the recovery of neurovascular function in penile tissues by immunofluorescence analysis. Results: The results showed that ADSC-EXOs restored erectile function in diabetic rats, as determined by the ICP/MAP ratio. Exosomes from ADSCs also promoted neurovascular function and suppressed expression of inflammatory factors. In contrast, the decreased content of corin in exosomes after silencing corin in ADSCs reduced the therapeutic effect of exosomes on ED.

In contrast, plant trichomes, known for their production of a large number of metabolites, are a yet unexplored habitat for microbes. We analyzed the phyllosphere as well as trichomes of two tomato genotypes (Solanum lycopersicum LA4024, S. habrochaites LA1777) by targeting bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments. Results Leaves, leaves without trichomes, and trichomes alone harbored similar abundances of bacteria (108\u2013109 16S rRNA gene copy numbers per gram of sample). In contrast, bacterial diversity was found significantly increased in trichome samples (Shannon index: 4.4 vs. 2.5). Moreover, the community composition was significantly different when assessed with beta diversity analysis and corresponding statistical tests. At the bacterial class level, Alphaproteobacteria (23.6%) were significantly increased, whereas Bacilli (8.6%) were decreased in trichomes. The bacterial family Sphingomonadacea (8.4%) was identified as the most prominent, trichome-specific feature; Burkholderiaceae and Actinobacteriaceae showed similar patterns. Moreover, Sphingomonas was identified as a central element in the core microbiome of trichome samples, while distinct low-abundant bacterial families including Hymenobacteraceae and Alicyclobacillaceae were exclusively found in trichome samples. Niche preferences were statistically significant for both genotypes and genotype-specific enrichments were further observed. Conclusion Our results provide first evidence of a highly specific trichome microbiome in tomato and show the importance of micro-niches for the structure of bacterial communities on leaves. These findings provide further clues for breeding, plant pathology and protection as well as so far unexplored natural pathogen defense strategies.", "title": "Trichomes form genotype-specific microbial hotspots in the phyllosphere of tomato", "journal": {"volume": "15", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://environmentalmicrobiome.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["2524-6372"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Environmental Microbiome"}, "month": "9", "start_page": "1"}, "id": "0012c2b206aa41aaba6c1cfc926bb5e8", "created_date": "2020-09-20T12:36:42Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:06:04Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/ijms21093103", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1422-0067", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "1661-6596", "type": "pissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "21", "number": "3103", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/about under Copyright/Open Access section"}], "issns": ["1422-0067", "1661-6596"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences"}, "month": "04", "keywords": ["neuronal stem cells", "neural subpopulation", "neurodegenerative disease", "cell therapy"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "3103", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}, {"code": "QD1-999", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Chemistry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Foundation IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neurology Unit, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Roberta De Gioia"}, {"affiliation": "Dino Ferrari Centre, Neuroscience Section, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation (DEPT), University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Fabio Biella"}, {"affiliation": "Dino Ferrari Centre, Neuroscience Section, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation (DEPT), University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Gaia Citterio"}, {"affiliation": "Foundation IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neurology Unit, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Federica Rizzo"}, {"affiliation": "Dino Ferrari Centre, Neuroscience Section, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation (DEPT), University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Elena Abati"}, {"affiliation": "Foundation IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neurology Unit, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Monica Nizzardo"}, {"affiliation": "Foundation IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neurology Unit, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Nereo Bresolin"}, {"affiliation": "Dino Ferrari Centre, Neuroscience Section, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation (DEPT), University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Giacomo  Pietro Comi"}, {"affiliation": "Foundation IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neurology Unit, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy", "name": "Stefania Corti"}], "link": [{"content_type": "text/html", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/9/3103"}], "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are disabling and fatal neurological disorders that currently lack effective treatment. Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been studied as a potential therapeutic approach and appears to exert a beneficial effect against neurodegeneration via different mechanisms, such as the production of neurotrophic factors, decreased neuroinflammation, enhanced neuronal plasticity and cell replacement. Thus, NSC transplantation may represent an effective therapeutic strategy. To exploit NSCs\u2019 potential, some of their essential biological characteristics must be thoroughly investigated, including the specific markers for NSC subpopulations, to allow profiling and selection. Another key feature is their secretome, which is responsible for the regulation of intercellular communication, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation. In addition, NSCs must properly migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and integrate into host neuronal circuits, enhancing neuroplasticity. Understanding and modulating these aspects can allow us to further exploit the therapeutic potential of NSCs. Recent progress in gene editing and cellular engineering techniques has opened up the possibility of modifying NSCs to express select candidate molecules to further enhance their therapeutic effects.

This is attested by the ever\u2010growing reference to the conservation of evolutionary potential in the scientific literature. The impression that one may have when reading papers is that conserving evolutionary potential can only be a good thing, whatever biological system is under scrutiny. However, different objectives, such as maintaining species richness versus ecosystem services, may express different, when not conflicting, underlying values attributed to biodiversity. For instance, biodiversity can be intrinsically valued, as worth it to be conserved per se, or it can be conserved as a means for human flourishing. Consequently, both the concept of evolutionary potential and the prescriptions derived from the commitment to conserve it remain problematic, due to a lack of explicit mention of the norms underlying different conservation visions. Here, we contend that those who advocate for the conservation of evolutionary potential should position their conception along four dimensions: what vehicles instantiate the evolutionary potential relevant to their normative commitment; what temporality is involved; how measurable evolutionary potential is, and what degree of human influence is tolerated. We need to address these dimensions if we are to determine why and when the maintenance of evolutionary potential is an appropriate target for the conservation of biodiversity.", "title": "The dimensions of evolutionary potential in biological conservation", "journal": {"volume": "13", "number": "6", "country": "US", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/17524571/homepage/open_access_license_and_copyright.htm"}], "issns": ["1752-4571"], "publisher": "Wiley", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Evolutionary Applications"}, "month": "07", "start_page": "1363"}, "id": "0013618110c14ce1b2ca5484597c2054", "created_date": "2020-07-14T15:36:51Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-27T08:10:45Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/app10238436", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-3417", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "10", "number": "8436", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2076-3417"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Applied Sciences"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["ultrasonic", "detection", "double-probe", "steel structure", "cracking"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "8436", "subject": [{"code": "T", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Technology"}, {"code": "TA1-2040", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Engineering (General).

The formulae for determining the depth and angle of crack were not only established but also analyzed the detection accuracy of the double-probe penetration method. The feasibility of this method in weld crack detection was verified by a combination of the finite-element simulation and actual experiment.

Such small insert sizes mean fewer longer reads, and also result in the presence of adapter at the end of the read. Here is presented a protocol to use publicly available tools to identify read pairs with small insert sizes and so  likely to contain adapter, to check the sequence of the adapter, and remove adapter sequence from the reads.

Since integration of the inferred changes of different histone modifications could reveal genes with specific histone marks such as active histone marks and bivalent histone marks on each internal branch of cell-type trees, this approach could provide valuable information for understanding the cell differentiation steps of each cell lineage.", "title": "Inferring changes in histone modification during cell differentiation by ancestral state estimation based on phylogenetic trees of cell types: Human hematopoiesis as a model case", "journal": {"volume": "3", "number": "", "country": "NL", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "https://www.elsevier.com/journals/gene-x/2590-1583/open-access-journal"}], "issns": ["2590-1583"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Gene: X"}, "month": "09", "start_page": ""}, "id": "0013f3e03da04cc9b9cd5194cf86c223", "created_date": "2020-05-18T05:01:33Z"}, {"last_updated": "2021-02-09T13:50:39Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1752-4571", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1111/eva.13077", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "2739", "keywords": ["computer simulation", "diagnosis", "drug resistance", "genetics", "population", "malaria"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "QH359-425", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Evolution"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Liverpool UK", "name": "Ian M.

Genetic selection can be incorporated into the IBMs to track the spread of mutations whose origin and spread are driven by the intervention and which subsequently undermine the control strategy; typical examples are mutations which encode drug resistance or diagnosis\u2010 or vaccine\u2010escape phenotypes. Methods and results We simulated the spread of malaria drug resistance using the IBM OpenMalaria to investigate how the finite sizes of IBMs require strategies to optimally incorporate genetic selection. We make four recommendations. Firstly, calculate and report the selection coefficients, s, of the advantageous allele as the key genetic parameter. Secondly, use these values of \u201cs\u201d to calculate the wait time until a mutation successfully establishes itself in the pathogen population. Thirdly, identify the inherent limits of the IBM to robustly estimate small selection coefficients. Fourthly, optimize computational efficacy: when \u201cs\u201d is small, fewer replicates of larger IBMs may be more efficient than a larger number of replicates of smaller size.

Fortunately, recent progress in system biology allows to screen the biomarkers for HCC prognosis in a high-throughput manner. In this study, we performed systematic Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the whole mRNA transcriptomics based on the Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) and developed a three-gene prognostic signature composing of three genes UPB1, SOCS2 and RTN3.

However, glioblastoma cells frequently show primary and acquired resistance to TMZ. As a promising anti-GBM candidate, resveratrol (Res) faces the similar problem as TMZ. Although resveratrol combined with TMZ (Res/TMZ) has been reported to be used to treat GBMs, it remains unclear whether this combination is broad-spectrum for all glioma cells until now, especially for GBM cells/cases with dual drug resistance. The study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of resveratrol and TMZ against GBMs and identify the underlying mechanisms.Materials and Methods: Drug sensitivities of rat RG-2, human LN-18 and LN-428 cell lines and effectiveness of Res/TMZ combinations were investigated via multiple experimental methods. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was observed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (ICC). Transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway and expression changes of STAT3-related gene were detected to explore the possible synergistic mechanism.Results: One hundred micromolar resveratrol and 500 &mu;M TMZ inhibited the growth of RG-2 cells and the low-dose combination (25 &mu;M/250 &mu;M) showed similar suppressive effects. LN-18 and, especially, LN-428 cells were neither sensitive to 100 &mu;M resveratrol nor to 500 &mu;M TMZ, while their growth was suppressed by combination of 75 &mu;M Res/750 &mu;M TMZ with the suppressive rates of 62.5% and 28.6% and apoptosis rates of 11.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Resveratrol had regulatory effect on the expression of MGMT and it could significantly down-regulate MGMT overexpression caused by TMZ. In addition, STAT3/Bcl-2/survivin signaling pathway was also remarkably inhibited in Res/TMZ-treated GBM cells.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated synergistic effects of Res/TMZ on RG-2 cells and their bilaterally sensitizing effects to LN-18 and LN-428 cells. Frequent upregulation of MGMT and activation of STAT3 are the unfavorable factors for the treatment of GBMs and they may be the potential targets of Res/TMZ therapy.Keywords: resveratrol, temozolomide, synergistic effects, glioblastoma, MGMT, STAT3, Bcl-2, survivin", "title": "Synergistic Effects of Resveratrol and Temozolomide Against Glioblastoma Cells: Underlying Mechanism and Therapeutic Implications", "journal": {"volume": "Volume 12", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC", "type": "CC BY-NC", "url": "http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045"}], "issns": ["1179-1322"], "publisher": "Dove Medical Press", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Cancer Management and Research"}, "month": "9", "start_page": "8341"}, "id": "00148018f8fd435f9c70de0463121f48", "created_date": "2020-09-13T21:06:09Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:57:25Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.13057/biodiv/d160101", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1412-033X", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2085-4722", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "9", "keywords": ["Beech stands", "Shannon-Wiener index", "stand structure", "uneven aged management"], "year": "2015", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Forestry, Khalkhal Branch, Islamic Azad University, Khalkhal, Iran.

The analysis approach employed an integrating quantitative method designed to eliminate bias among different transcriptomic studies. The analysis highlighted 764 meta-genes (366 downregulated and 398 upregulated) in macular AMD RPE/choroid and 445 meta-genes (244 downregulated and 201 upregulated) in non-macular AMD RPE/choroid. Of these, 731 genes were newly detected as differentially expressed (DE) genes in macular AMD RPE/choroid and 434 genes in non-macular AMD RPE/choroid compared with controls. Over-representation analysis of KEGG pathways associated with these DE genes mapped revealed two most significantly associated biological processes in macular RPE/choroid in AMD, namely the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway (represented by 30 DE genes) and the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction signaling pathway (represented by 12 DE genes). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified two central hub genes involved in the control of cell proliferation/differentiation processes, HDAC1 and CDK1.

However, it is barely understood how complex promoter architectures determine key features of promoter dynamics. Here, we employ prototypical promoters of yeast ribosomal protein genes as well as simplified versions thereof to analyze the relations among promoter design, complexity, and function. These promoters combine the action of a general regulatory factor with that of specific transcription factors, a common motif of many eukaryotic promoters. By comprehensively analyzing stationary and dynamic promoter properties, this model-based approach enables us to pinpoint the structural characteristics underlying the observed behavior. Functional tradeoffs impose constraints on the promoter architecture of ribosomal protein genes. We find that a stable scaffold in the natural design results in low transcriptional noise and strong co-regulation of target genes in the presence of gene silencing. This configuration also exhibits superior shut-off properties, and it can serve as a tunable switch in living cells. Model validation with independent experimental data suggests that the models are sufficiently realistic.

However, the relationships between microbial dynamics, age-related changes in intestinal physiology, and organismal health remain poorly understood. Here, we show that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by an expansion of the Gammaproteobacteria, is tightly linked to age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction in Drosophila. Indeed, alterations in the microbiota precede and predict the onset of intestinal barrier dysfunction in aged flies. Changes in microbial composition occurring prior to intestinal barrier dysfunction contribute to changes in excretory function and immune gene activation in the aging intestine. In addition, we show that a distinct shift in microbiota composition follows intestinal barrier dysfunction, leading to systemic immune activation and organismal death. Our results indicate that alterations in microbiota dynamics could contribute to and also predict varying rates of health decline during aging in mammals.", "title": "Distinct Shifts in Microbiota Composition during Drosophila Aging Impair Intestinal Function and Drive Mortality"}, "created_date": "2015-09-11T10:03:52Z", "id": "0016820b422e4f17951d4d2e83b1016f"}, {"last_updated": "2021-02-10T00:02:12Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/app11041559", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-3417", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "11", "number": "1559", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2076-3417"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Applied Sciences"}, "month": "02", "keywords": ["self-excitation", "damping", "multiple scales Lindstedt-Poincar\u00e9", "drill string", "torsional vibration"], "year": "2021", "start_page": "1559", "subject": [{"code": "T", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Technology"}, {"code": "TA1-2040", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Engineering (General).

Especially self-excited oscillations of higher-order modes lead to critical dynamic loads. The slim drill string design and the naturally limited drilled borehole diameter limit the installation space, power supply and lead to numerous potentially critical self-excited torsional modes. Consequently, small and robust passive damping concepts are required. The variety of possible downhole boundary conditions and potential damper designs necessitates analytical solutions for effective damper design and optimization. In this paper, two nonlinear passive damper concepts are investigated regarding design and effectiveness to reduce self-excited high-frequency torsional oscillations in drill string dynamics. Based on a finite element model of a drill string, a suitable minimal model based on the identified critical mode is generated and solved analytically using the Multiple Scales Lindstedt-Poincar\u00e9 (MSLP) method. The advantages of MSLP compared to conventional MS methods are shown for this example. On the basis of the analytical solution, parameter influences are determined, and design equations are derived. The analytical results are transferred to self-excited drill string vibrations and discussed using time domain simulations of the drill string model.", "title": "A Method for the Design and Optimization of Nonlinear Tuned Damping Concepts to Mitigate Self-Excited Drill String Vibrations Using Multiple Scales Lindstedt-Poincar\u00e9"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0016b89aa65144e797e7dd65176f1e40", "created_date": "2021-02-10T00:02:11Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T21:47:27Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2211-1247", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.097", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "918", "keywords": ["reward", "aversion", "topography", "tracing", "connectivity", "network", "channelrhodopsin", "phototagging", "photoexcitation", "photoinhition"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Anna Beyeler"}, {"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Chia-Jung Chang"}, {"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Margaux Silvestre"}, {"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Cl\u00e9mentine L\u00e9v\u00eaque"}, {"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Praneeth Namburi"}, {"affiliation": "The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA", "name": "Craig P.

Although there is consensus regarding the existence of distinct subsets of BLA neurons encoding positive or negative valence, controversy remains regarding the anatomical arrangement of these populations. First, we map the location of more than 1,000 neurons distributed across the BLA and recorded during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Next, we determine the location of projection-defined neurons labeled with retrograde tracers and use CLARITY to reveal the axonal path in 3-dimensional space.

Today there are more than 150 methods for eliminating congenital defects of the hard and soft palate. However, these techniques do not always lead to high functional results, which leads to repeated surgical interventions and long-term speech therapy rehabilitation. Therefore, there is a problem with the prognosis of such treatment. The search for a marker for assessing the prognosis of surgical intervention is relevant. One of these markers may be the state of the myogenic potential of stem cells.\n\r\n\nObjective: to analyze the possibility of preliminary assessment of muscle regeneration, depending on the myogenic potential of stem cells, in order to increase the effectiveness of treatment of children with non-union of the soft palate.\n\r\n\nMethod. An analytical review of the literature on keywords from the scientometric databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science.\n\r\n\nResults. Satellite cells represent an adequate system model for studying the biology of adult stem cells. Satellite cells can be considered candidates for cell therapy in muscle regeneration. First, they are one of the most abundant and most accessible cells in our body. Secondly, there is a panel of specific markers that can be used to isolate satellite cells. Third, satellite cells are localized within clear boundaries of the anatomical niche, and signaling mechanisms are currently being studied. Fourth, there is the possibility of recreating muscle injuries in which satellite cells can be studied. Future research aimed at increasing the purification of satellite cells so as to maintain their low differentiation, increase the engraftment potential, as well as new approaches aimed at obtaining satellite cells from iPS cells, will help accelerate the progress and development of drugs for cell therapy in the treatment of muscle degenerative diseases.\n\r\n\nConclusions. The data on the myogenic potential of stem cells, in muscle regeneration, obtained on satellite cell models, can be used to increase the effectiveness of the treatment of children with nonunion of the soft palate.", "title": "POSSIBILITIES OF REGENERATION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE DURING ITS NONUNION DEPENDING ON THE MYOGENIC POTENTIAL OF STEM CELLS.

Despite the advances that have been made in understanding the chemistry and biology of the anthraquinones in recent years, research into their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential in autoimmune disorders is still at an early stage. In this paper, we briefly introduce the etiology of autoimmune diabetes, an autoimmune disorder that affects as many as 10 million worldwide, and the role of chemotaxis in autoimmune diabetes.

During iCM reprogramming, the starting fibroblasts must overcome existing epigenetic barriers to acquire the CM-like chromatin pattern. However, epigenetic dynamics along this reprogramming process have not been studied. Here, we took advantage of our recently generated polycistronic system and determined the dynamics of two critical histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in parallel with gene expression at a set of carefully selected cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming. We observed reduced H3K27me3 and increased H3K4me3 at cardiac promoters as early as day 3, paralleled by a rapid significant increase in their mRNA expression. In contrast, H3K27me3 at loci encoding fibroblast marker genes did not increase until day 10 and H3K4me3 progressively decreased along the reprogramming process; these changes were accompanied by a gradual decrease in the mRNA expression of fibroblast marker genes. Further analyses of fibroblast-enriched transcription factors revealed a similarly late deposition of H3K27me3 and decreased mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1 and Twist2, three important players in epithelial\u2212mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest early rapid activation of the cardiac program and later progressive suppression of fibroblast fate at both epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Additionally, we determined the DNA methylation states of representative cardiac promoters and found that not every single CpG was equally demethylated during early stages of iCM reprogramming. Rather, there are specific CpGs, whose demethylation states correlated tightly with transcription activation, that we propose are the major contributing CpGs. Our work thus reveals a differential re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 at cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming and could provide future genome-wide epigenetic studies with important guidance such as the appropriate time window and loci to be utilized as positive and negative controls.", "title": "Re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and DNA methylation during fibroblast conversion into induced cardiomyocytes", "journal": {"volume": "16", "number": "2", "country": "NL", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "http://www.elsevier.com/journals/stem-cell-research/1873-5061/guide-for-authors#13530"}], "issns": ["1873-5061", "1876-7753"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Stem Cell Research"}, "month": "3", "start_page": "507"}, "created_date": "2016-04-27T13:01:52Z", "id": "00182e18b6e943d78f60b835ae987f5c"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:14:40Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2095-3941", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2095-3941", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.7497/j.issn.2095-3941.2015.0026", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "number": "2", "country": "CN", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC", "type": "CC BY-NC", "url": "http://www.cancerbiomed.org/index.php/cocr/about/editorialPolicies#custom-0"}], "issns": ["2095-3941"], "publisher": "China Anti-Cancer Association", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Cancer Biology & Medicine"}, "month": "6", "end_page": "73", "year": "2015", "start_page": "71", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neoplasms.

A xenograft tumor model in the mouse was used to image vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) expression with microbubbles conjugated to an anti-VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibody or an isotype control.

We have previously shown that farming mothers consume more full-fat dairy than control mothers, who instead consume more low-fat dairy, margarine, and oils; margarine and oil intake was associated with increased risk of allergy development in their children. Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in diet between children in farming and control families at 1 year of age, to investigate the relation between the diets of the mothers and their children, and to relate the children's diet to allergy development. Design: The diet of 1-year-old children from dairy farming families (n=28) and from control families in the same rural area (n=37) was assessed by 24-h dietary recalls, followed by 24-h food diaries. Allergy was diagnosed by pediatricians at 3 years of age using strict predefined criteria. Results: Farm children had a higher intake of farm milk, whole cream, cholesterol, saturated fat, and fat in total and tended to eat more butter, while controls consumed more carbohydrates and poultry and tended to eat more margarine. Farm children also had higher intakes of homemade porridge/gruel, oily fish, and iodine. The intake of butter and whole milk in children and mothers correlated significantly in farm families but not in controls. A weak negative association was found between seafood intake and allergy development, while allergy was positively associated with the intake of pork as well as zinc in the control group; these intakes also correlated with each other. Conclusions: Consistent with mothers in farming families, the children consumed more full-fat dairy and saturated fat than did controls, but this could not be linked to the low risk of allergy in the farming group.

To improve the quality of the fiber-based products in the future, a thorough understanding of the main cell wall polymer biosynthetic pathways is required. In this study we have carried out a characterization of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis in flax along with some of their regulation mechanisms. Results We have first identified the members of the phenylpropanoid gene families through a combination of in silico approaches. The more specific lignin genes were further characterized by high throughput transcriptomic approaches in different organs and physiological conditions and their cell/tissue expression was localized in the stems, roots and leaves. Laccases play an important role in the polymerization of monolignols. This multigenic family was determined and a miRNA was identified to play a role in the posttranscriptional regulation by cleaving the transcripts of some specific genes shown to be expressed in lignified tissues. In situ hybridization also showed that the miRNA precursor was expressed in the young xylem cells located near the vascular cambium. The results obtained in this work also allowed us to determine that most of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis are included in a unique co-expression cluster and that MYB transcription factors are potentially good candidates for regulating these genes. Conclusions Target engineering of cell walls to improve plant product quality requires good knowledge of the genes responsible for the production of the main polymers. For bast fiber plants such as flax, it is important to target the correct genes from the beginning since the difficulty to produce transgenic material does not make possible to test a large number of genes. Our work determined which of these genes could be potentially modified and showed that it was possible to target different regulatory pathways to modify lignification.", "title": "Spatial regulation of monolignol biosynthesis and laccase genes control developmental and stress-related lignin in flax", "journal": {"volume": "17", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/about"}], "issns": ["1471-2229"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Plant Biology"}, "month": "7", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-08-14T14:31:44Z", "id": "001919278aa545f5ae370156c1cd7b3b"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T20:56:25Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1909-2520", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2590-8219", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.26620/uniminuto.inventum.4.6.2009.66-72", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "72", "keywords": ["Control", "botrytis cin\u00e9rea", "fresa", "virobat", "starzyme", "mycobac."], "year": "2009", "subject": [{"code": "TA1-2040", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Engineering (General).

Capsule Endoscopy (CE) may provide a useful adjunct in screening for polyposis in the small bowel in FAP patients. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CE in the assessment of patients with FAP, compared to other imaging modalities for the detection of small bowel polyps.</p> <p>Method</p> <p>20 consecutive patients with previously diagnosed FAP and duodenal polyps, presenting for routine surveillance of polyps at The Royal Melbourne Hospital were recruited. Each fasted patient initially underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the abdomen, and a barium small bowel follow-through study. Capsule Endoscopy was performed four weeks later on the fasted patient. An upper gastrointestinal side-viewing endoscopy was done one (1) to two (2) weeks after this. Endoscopists and investigators were blinded to results of other investigations and patient history.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Within the stomach, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy found more polyps than other forms of imaging.

Although the platelets are fewer than 50 \u00d7 109/L in 8 THC2 family members, only the proband and her son show a higher WHO bleeding score. The proband and her son are also beta-thalassemia carriers with heterozygous c.52A &gt; T mutation of HBB, which might not be associated with the increased bleeding tendency since 3 other family members with low bleeding tendency also carried both ANKRD26 c.-128G &gt; T and HBB c.52A &gt; T mutations. However, the proband and her son also show hypofibrinogenaemia, which is likely the cause of their more severe clinical manifestation.

Melatonin (MLT) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have properties to modulate both, but their protective role, mainly at early stages of prostate cancer, remains unclear. In this study, the effects of MLT and DHA, combined or not, on PNT1A cells with regard to mitochondria bioenergetics, ROS production, and proliferation-related pathways were examined. Based on dose response and lipid accumulation assays, DHA at 100\u2009\u03bcM and MLT at 1\u2009\u03bcM for 48\u2009h were chosen. DHA doubled and MLT reduced (40%) superoxide anion production, but coincubation (DM) did not normalize to control. Hydrogen peroxide production decreased after MLT incubation only (p<0.01). These alterations affected the area and perimeter of mitochondria, since DHA increased whereas MLT decreased, but such hormone has no effect on coincubation. DHA isolated did not change the oxidative phosphorylation rate (OXPHOS), but decreased (p<0.001) the mitochondrial bioenergetic reserve capacity (MBRC) which is closely related to cell responsiveness to stress conditions. MLT, regardless of DHA, ameliorated OXPHOS and recovered MBRC after coincubation. All incubations decreased AKT phosphorylation; however, only MLT alone inhibited p-mTOR. MLT increased p-ERK1/2 and, when combined to DHA, increased GSTP1 expression (p<0.01). DHA did not change the testosterone levels in the medium, whereas MLT alone or coincubated decreased by about 20%; however, any incubation affected AR expression. Moreover, incubation with luzindole revealed that MLT effects were MTR1/2-independent. In conclusion, DHA increased ROS production and impaired mitochondrial function which was probably related to AKT inactivation; MLT improved OXPHOS and decreased ROS which was related to AKT/mTOR dephosphorylation, and when coincubated, the antiproliferative action was related to mitochondrial bioenergetic modulation associated to AKT and ERK1/2 regulation. Together, these findings point to the potential application of DHA and MLT towards the prevention of proliferative prostate diseases.", "title": "Melatonin and Docosahexaenoic Acid Decrease Proliferation of PNT1A Prostate Benign Cells via Modulation of Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and ROS Production"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-01-22T07:46:52Z", "id": "001aa0525a1c4173b2bfd9a61b0b6414"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:58:00Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "0354-4664", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "1821-4339", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.2298/ABS1304387Z", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "65", "number": "4", "country": "RS", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "http://www.serbiosoc.org.rs/arch/index.php/abs/about/editorialPolicies#openAccessPolicy"}], "issns": ["0354-4664", "1821-4339"], "publisher": "University of Belgrade, University of Novi Sad", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Archives of Biological Sciences"}, "end_page": "1396", "keywords": ["Fatty acids", "pelleted feed", "extruded feed", "carp", "Chironomidae larvae"], "year": "2013", "start_page": "1387", "subject": [{"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Belgrade", "name": "\u017divi\u0107 Ivana"}, {"affiliation": "Institute of Meat Hygiene and Technology, Belgrade", "name": "Trbovi\u0107 Dejana"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Belgrade", "name": "\u017divi\u0107 M."}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Belgrade", "name": "Bjelanovi\u0107 Katarina"}, {"affiliation": "State University of Novi Pazar, Department of Biochemical and Medical Sciences, Novi Pazar", "name": "Markovi\u0107 Z.S."}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Belgrade", "name": "Stankovi\u0107 M."}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Belgrade", "name": "Markovi\u0107 Z."}], "link": [{"content_type": "pdf", "type": "fulltext", "url": "http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0354-4664/2013/0354-46641304387Z.pdf"}], "abstract": "In order to examine how extruded and pelleted feed affects the fatty acid\n   composition of carp meat and Chironomidae larvae, two-month-old carp\n   specimens were set in two fishponds (L1 and L2).

The input parameters were represented by lithology, land use, slope inclination and average annual precipitation. These parameters were evaluated as independent variables, and the existing landslides as dependent variables. The individual input parameters were reclassified and spatially adjusted. Spatial analysis resulted in 15 988 combinations of input parameters representing the homogeneous condition unit (HCU ). Based on the landslide density within individual units, the HCU polygons have been classified according to landslide risk into stable, conditionally stable, conditionally stable and unstable (subdivided into low, medium and high landslide risk). A total of 2002 HCU s were affected by landslides, and the remaining 13 986 were not affected. The total HCU area affected by landslides is about 156.92 km2 (20.1%). Stable areas covered 623.01 km2 (79.8%), and conditionally stable areas covered 228.77 km2 (29.33% out of this area). Unstable areas were divided into three levels of landslide risk - low, medium and high risk. An area of 111.19 km2 (14.3%) represents low landslide risk, medium risk 29.7 km2 (3.8%) and 16.01 km2 (2%) represents high risk.

This lithological formation covers the largest area within all landslide risk classes as well as in conditionally stable areas. The most frequent slope class was in the range of 14-19. The higher susceptibility of Zl\u00edn Formation to landslides is caused mainly by different geomorphological value of claystone and sandstone sequence.

The production mechanism of the secondary polyphenols in black tea, whisky, cinnamon, and persimmon fruits will be introduced. In the process of black tea production, tea leaf catechins are enzymatically oxidized to yield a complex mixture of oxidation products, including theaflavins and thearubigins. Despite the importance of the beverage, most of the chemical constituents have not yet been confirmed due to the complexity of the mixture. However, the reaction mechanisms at the initial stages of catechin oxidation are explained by simple quinone\u2013phenol coupling reactions. In vitro model experiments indicated the presence of interesting regio- and stereoselective reactions. Recent results on the reaction mechanisms will be introduced. During the aging of whisky in oak wood barrels, ellagitannins originating from oak wood are oxidized and react with ethanol to give characteristic secondary ellagitannins. The major part of the cinnamon procyanidins is polymerized by copolymerization with cinnamaldehyde. In addition, anthocyanidin structural units are generated in the polymer molecules by oxidation which accounts for the reddish coloration of the cinnamon extract. This reaction is related to the insolubilization of proanthocyanidins in persimmon fruits by condensation with acetaldehyde. In addition to oxidation, the reaction of polyphenols with aldehydes may be important in food processing.

Analyzing the morphometrics of three Sinocyclocheilus species, we aimed to assess whether variability among conspecific populations exists. We predict that populations inhabiting different subterranean habitats (shallow vs. deep) show divergences in specific morphological traits to better cope with the local ecological conditions. Our results showed that the populations showing bigger eyes and reduced humpback were those occurring close to the cave entrance (habitats with light and high food availability), while specimens with smaller eyes and increased humpback were collected from deeper groundwater areas (habitats laying in darkness with food scarcity).

The mean tissue concentrations of TFWT (OBT) were 30.9 (17.8) and 4.4 (8.1) Bq/g on days 7 and 13\u00a0at the 37 kBq level and 30.8 (64.6) Bq/g on day 17\u00a0at the 370 kBq level. To assess the cytogenetic damage due to tritium exposure, a cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (MN) assay was performed in blood samples from rats exposed to HTO for 14 and 21 days after oral administration. There was no significant difference in the MN frequencies between the control and exposed rats.

A chief contributor to this barrier is the impact on microbial processes and energy metabolism of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, including phenolic carboxylates, phenolic amides (for ammonia-pretreated biomass), phenolic aldehydes, and furfurals. To understand the bacterial pathways induced by inhibitors present in ammonia-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, which are less well studied than acid-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, we developed and exploited synthetic mimics of ammonia-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH). To determine regulatory responses to the inhibitors normally present in ACSH, we measured transcript and protein levels in an Escherichia coli ethanologen using RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics during fermentation to ethanol of synthetic hydrolysates containing or lacking the inhibitors. Our study identified four major regulators mediating these responses, the MarA/SoxS/Rob network, AaeR, FrmR, and YqhC. Induction of these regulons was correlated with a reduced rate of ethanol production, buildup of pyruvate, depletion of ATP and NAD(P)H, and an inhibition of xylose conversion. The aromatic aldehyde inhibitor 5-hydroxymethylfurfural appeared to be reduced to its alcohol form by the ethanologen during fermentation, whereas phenolic acid and amide inhibitors were not metabolized. Together, our findings establish that the major regulatory responses to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors are mediated by transcriptional rather than translational regulators, suggest that energy consumed for inhibitor efflux and detoxification may limit biofuel production, and identify a network of regulators for future synthetic biology efforts.", "title": "Aromatic inhibitors derived from ammonia-pretreated lignocellulose hinder bacterial ethanologenesis by activating regulatory circuits controlling inhibitor efflux and detoxification"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2014-09-16T14:36:37Z", "id": "001cf026d0fd4b66bde5e420055ed7c7"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:57:36Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1414-431X", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1590/1414-431X20143965", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "127", "keywords": ["Cardiovascular diseases", "Insomnia", "Night work", "Nurse", "Sleep"], "year": "2015", "subject": [{"code": "R5-920", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine (General)"}, {"code": "QH301-705.5", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)"}], "author": [{"name": "A.

Studies of CVD generally do not simultaneously consider                     sleep and work schedules, but that approach could help to disentangle their                     effects.

A cross-sectional study was                     conducted in 1307 female nursing professionals from 3 public hospitals, using                     baseline data from the \u201cHealth and Work in Nursing - a Cohort                     Study.\u201d Participants were divided into two groups: i) day workers with no                     previous experience in night shifts (n=281) and whose data on insomnia were                     related to nocturnal sleep and ii) those who worked exclusively at night (n=340)                     and had data on both nocturnal and diurnal sleep episodes, as they often sleep                     at daytime.

Such dyskinesia is associated with aberrant gene regulation in neurons of the striatum, which is caused by abnormal dopamine release from serotonin terminals. Previous work showed that modulating the striatal serotonin innervation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 5-HT1A receptor agonists could attenuate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We investigated the effects of a novel serotonergic agent, vilazodone, which combines SSRI and 5-HT1A partial agonist properties, on L-DOPA-induced behavior and gene regulation in the striatum in an animal model of Parkinson\u2019s disease. After unilateral dopamine depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), rats received repeated L-DOPA treatment (5 mg/kg) alone or in combination with vilazodone (10 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. Gene regulation was then mapped throughout the striatum using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Vilazodone suppressed the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and turning behavior but did not interfere with the prokinetic effects of L-DOPA (forelimb stepping). L-DOPA treatment drastically increased the expression of dynorphin (direct pathway), 5-HT1B, and zif268 mRNA in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion. These effects were inhibited by vilazodone. In contrast, vilazodone had no effect on enkephalin expression (indirect pathway) or on gene expression in the intact striatum. Thus, vilazodone inhibited L-DOPA-induced gene regulation selectively in the direct pathway of the dopamine-depleted striatum, molecular changes that are considered critical for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. These findings position vilazodone, an approved antidepressant, as a potential adjunct medication for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced motor side effects.", "title": "The Multimodal Serotonergic Agent Vilazodone Inhibits L-DOPA-Induced Gene Regulation in Striatal Projection Neurons and Associated Dyskinesia in an Animal Model of Parkinson\u2019s Disease"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "001d813913a943428ef1453501053d45", "created_date": "2020-10-10T00:02:06Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T21:59:10Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s12864-018-5164-1", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1471-2164", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "12", "keywords": ["Whole-genome amplification", "High molecular weight DNA", "Long read sequencing", "Palindromes", "Chimeric reads", "de novo assembly"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "TP248.13-248.65", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biotechnology"}, {"code": "QH426-470", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Genetics"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Sven Warris"}, {"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Elio Schijlen"}, {"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Henri van de Geest"}, {"affiliation": "Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, Pennsylvania State University, University Park", "name": "Rahulsimham Vegesna"}, {"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Thamara Hesselink"}, {"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Bas te Lintel Hekkert"}, {"affiliation": "Applied Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research", "name": "Gabino Sanchez Perez"}, {"affiliation": "The Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park", "name": "Paul Medvedev"}, {"affiliation": "The Center for Medical Genomics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park", "name": "Kateryna D.

After applying exogenous melatonin, the suppression of MdFRK2 expression was significantly rescued in transgenic apples overexpressing MdFRK2 via the 35S promoter. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose concentrations increased less as compared to WT apple plants. Wild-type plants showed a stunted phenotype 21 days after melatonin treatment, while MdFRK2-overexpressing plants exhibited slightly inhibited growth, indicating that the downregulated MdFRK2 expression in response to melatonin was involved in melatonin-mediated growth inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate the involvement of MdFRK2 in melatonin-induced sugar accumulation and growth inhibition. Our findings shed light on the roles played by MdFRK2 in connecting melatonin action and plant growth.", "title": "Melatonin-Mediated Sugar Accumulation and Growth Inhibition in Apple Plants Involves Down-Regulation of Fructokinase 2 Expression and Activity"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-02-19T05:08:13Z", "id": "001dc77bf4cb4a03a43ff9b528622d59"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:11:35Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-042X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01141", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/physiology#about"}], "issns": ["1664-042X"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Physiology"}, "month": "8", "keywords": ["FGR", "IUGR", "melatonin", "pregnancy", "mouse models", "eNOS"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "QP1-981", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Physiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Maternal and Fetal Health Research Centre, Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom", "name": "Lewis J.

Melatonin, a neurohormone and antioxidant, has been suggested as having therapeutic benefit in FGR. We tested the hypothesis that melatonin would increase fetal growth in two mouse models of FGR which together represent a spectrum of the placental phenotypes in this complication: namely the endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mouse (eNOS-/-) which presents with abnormal uteroplacental blood flow, and the placental specific Igf2 knockout mouse (P0+/-) which demonstrates aberrant placental morphology akin to human FGR. Melatonin (5 \u03bcg/ml) was administered via drinking water from embryonic day (E)12.5 in C57Bl/6J wild-type (WT), eNOS-/-, and P0+/- mice. Melatonin supplementation significantly increased fetal weight in WT, but not eNOS-/- or P0+/- mice at E18.5. Melatonin did, however, significantly increase abdominal circumference in P0+/- mice. Melatonin had no effect on placental weight in any group. Uterine arteries from eNOS-/- mice demonstrated aberrant function compared with WT but melatonin treatment did not affect uterine artery vascular reactivity in either of these genotypes. Umbilical arteries from melatonin treated P0+/- mice demonstrated increased relaxation in response to the nitric oxide donor SNP compared with control. The increased fetal weight in WT mice and abdominal circumference in P0+/-, together with the lack of any effect in eNOS-/-, suggest that the presence of eNOS is required for the growth promoting effects of melatonin.

Major risk factors involved in the development of CRC are increased dietary sources, genetics, and increasing age. Purpose of the study was to find the role of different variables in the progression of CRC.Methodology50 blood samples from CRC patients and 20 samples from control were collected. Serum was separated from the blood by centrifugation. This serum was assessed for several antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, vitamin A, C, and E, and pro-oxidants such as malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), and AGEs according to their respective protocols. Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and isoprostanes were assessed by ELISA kits.ResultsLower levels of GSH (4.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78 vs 9.65\u2009\u00b1\u20091.13\u2009\u03bcg/dl), SOD (0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.012 vs 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.017\u2009\u03bcg/dl), CAT (2.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 vs 4.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\u2009\u03bcmol/mol of protein), and GRx (5.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 vs 7.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009\u03bcmol/ml) in the diseased group were recorded as compared with control. Higher levels of GPx (6.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\u2009mmol/dl) were observed in the subjects in comparison with control group (1.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u2009mmol/dl). Highly significant decreased levels of vitamin A (0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 vs 2.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15\u2009mg/ml), vitamin E (15.42\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26 vs 25.96\u2009\u00b1\u20092.19\u2009mg/ml), and vitamin C (47.67\u2009\u00b1\u20097.69 vs 80.37\u2009\u00b1\u200910.21\u2009mg/ml) were observed in the patients in contrast to control group. The reversal of antioxidants in later stages of CRC may be due to compensatory mechanisms in cancerous cells. The levels of MDA (nmol/ml) were also assessed, which shows significantly increased level in CRC patients as compared with control groups (3.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 vs 1.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27). The levels of protein oxidation products [AGEs (2.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16 vs 0.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009IU) and AOPPs (1.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 vs 0.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009ng/ml)] were significantly increased in subjects as compared with control. The levels of MMP-7 (64.75\u2009\u00b1\u20093.03 vs 50.61\u2009\u00b1\u20094.09\u2009ng/ml) and isoprostanes (0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 vs 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009ng/ml) were also analyzed. This shows that the levels of isoprostanes increased due to high lipid peroxidation mediate higher levels of MMP-7, which promotes development of CRC.ConclusionFollowing study suggested that elevated oxidative and inflammatory status along with lipid peroxidation and matrix metalloproteinases are the chief contributors in the progression of CRC.", "title": "Implications of Isoprostanes and Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 Having Potential Role in the Development of Colorectal Cancer in Males"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-06-07T05:19:55Z", "id": "001de709627143a29eefb9778171bb9a"}], "prev": "https://doaj.org/api/v2/search/articles/%22biology%22?page=1&pageSize=100", "next": "https://doaj.org/api/v2/search/articles/%22biology%22?page=3&pageSize=100", "last": "https://doaj.org/api/v2/search/articles/%22biology%22?page=4489&pageSize=100"}, {"total": 20, "page": 1, "pageSize": 100, "timestamp": "2021-02-27T04:41:19.193036Z", "query": "\"electrical AND engineering\"", "results": [{"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:19:21Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1729-8814", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1177/1729881417703776", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "14", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/author-instructions/arx"}], "issns": ["1729-8814"], "publisher": "SAGE Publishing", "language": ["EN"], "title": "International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems"}, "month": "5", "year": "2017", "subject": [{"code": "TK7800-8360", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Electronics"}, {"code": "QA75.5-76.95", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Electronic computers.

Second, a traditional sparse dictionary is learned from patches with a fixed size, which may not capture the exact information of the images and may ignore the fact that images naturally come at different scales in many cases. Finally, traditional sparse dictionary learning methods aim at learning a universal and overcomplete dictionary. However, many different local structural patterns exist. One dictionary is inadequate in capturing all of the different structures. We propose a novel IR image SR method to overcome these problems. First, we combine the information from multisensors to improve the resolution of the IR image. Then, we use multiscale patches to represent the image in a more efficient manner.

The proposed method uses sparse coding to classify the focused regions and defocused regions to obtain the focus feature maps. Then, a guided filter (GF) is used to calculate the score maps. An initial decision map can be obtained by comparing the score maps.

It uses received time series at cell under test (CUT) with different polarizations as distinct mixtures. The proposed detector can exploit all information of polarimetric radar for an accurate detection. It does separation on the mixtures using CERBM which results in two output sources, i.e. clutter and target. Finally, the target is detected using estimation of the parameters of K-distribution for outputted sources. Our experiments on the recognized IPIX radar database show that the proposed detector obtains better detection performance in comparison to the newly proposed detectors.

We developed a prosthetic hand for amputees with a thumb and metacarpal. In this case of amputation, the installation of actuators and electrical components is difficult because space is considerably limited owing to the residual metacarpal. This design issue is solved by installing actuators vertically between finger modules and the mounting part where the electrical parts are embedded. With this design, the arrangement between the palm of the patient and the fingers of the prosthetic hand can be adjusted as well. Weight is also an especially important design issue in the development of a practical prosthetic hand because the patient perceives that weight. Most prosthetic hands are attached to the residual limb of the amputee by compressing the contact surface between the product and the amputated body part of the patient. Heavy weight causes users to feel discomfort and fatigue over extended periods of usage. In this study, all frames used in the proposed prosthetic hand were fabricated from nylon using multi-jet-fusion three-dimensional printing. As a result, the weight of the developed prosthetic hand was only 152.32 g but still had the desired strength and stiffness. Each prosthetic finger has four-degree-of-freedom. The distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joints are coupled and driven by power from an actuator, which is transferred to each joint through the tendons.

In the DCSFCL, the permanent magnets (PM) are added on both up and down side of the core to generate reverse magnetic flux that offset the magnetic flux generated by DC current and make the DC winding present a variable inductance to the DC system. In normal state, DCSFCL works as a smoothing reactor and its inductance is within the scope of the design requirements. When a fault occurs, the inductance of DCSFCL rises immediately and limits the steepness of the fault current.

Force field studies, in which subjects have to adapt to dynamic perturbations induced by a robotic manipulandum, are an established tool to analyze the characteristics of such internal models. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether catch trials during force field learning could influence the consolidation of motor memory in more complex tasks. Thereby, the force field was more than double the force field of previous studies (35 Ns/m). Moreover, the arm of the subjects was not supported. A total of forty-six subjects participated in this study and performed center-out movements at a robotic manipulandum in two different force fields. Two control groups learned force field A on day 1 and were retested in the same force field on day 3 (AA). Two test groups additionally learned an interfering force field B (=-A) on day 2 (ABA). The difference between the two test and control groups, respectively, was the absence (0%) or presence (19%) of catch trials, in which the force field was turned off suddenly. The results showed consolidation of force field A on day 3 for both control groups. Test groups showed no consolidation of force field A (19% catch trials) and even poorer performance on day 3 (0% catch trials). In conclusion, it can be stated that catch trials seem to have a positive effect on the performance on day 3 but do not trigger a consolidation process as shown in previous studies that used a lower force field viscosity with supported arm. These findings indicate that the results of previous studies in which less complex tasks were analyzed, cannot be fully transferred to more complex tasks.

Variation in transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has been associated with enhanced neuroinflammation during aging and with TDP-43-related neurodegenerative disease, and rs3173615, a missense coding SNP in TMEM106B, has been implicated as a functional variant in these processes. Neuroinflammation and TDP-43 pathology are prominent features in CTE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic variation in TMEM106B is associated with CTE risk, pathological features, and ante-mortem dementia. Eighty-six deceased male athletes with a history of participation in American football, informant-reported Caucasian, and a positive postmortem diagnosis of CTE without comorbid neurodegenerative disease were genotyped for rs3173615. The minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009=\u20090.42) in participants with CTE did not differ from previously reported neurologically normal controls (MAF\u2009=\u20090.43). However, in a case-only analysis among CTE cases, the minor allele was associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) (AT8 density, odds ratio [OR] of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22\u20130.79, p\u2009=\u20090.008), reduced neuroinflammation in the DLFC (CD68 density, OR of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.53, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.98, p\u2009=\u20090.043), and increased synaptic protein density (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.306, 95% CI 0.065\u20130.546, p\u2009=\u20090.014). Among CTE cases, TMEM106B minor allele was also associated with reduced ante-mortem dementia (OR\u2009=\u20090.40, 95% CI 0.16\u20130.99, p\u2009=\u20090.048), but was not associated with TDP-43 pathology. All case-only models were adjusted for age at death and duration of football play.

While considerable research has focused on ORN responses to odorants, the mechanisms by which olfactory information is encoded in the activities of ORNs and translated into navigational behavior remain poorly understood. We sought to determine the contributions of most Drosophila melanogaster larval ORNs to navigational behavior. Using odorants to activate ORNs and a larval tracking assay to measure the corresponding behavioral response, we observed that larval ORN activators cluster into four groups based on the behavior responses elicited from larvae. This is significant because it provides new insights into the functional relationship between ORN activity and behavioral response. Subsequent optogenetic analyses of a subset of ORNs revealed previously undescribed properties of larval ORNs. Furthermore, our results indicated that different temporal patterns of ORN activation elicit different behavioral outputs: some ORNs respond to stimulus increments while others respond to stimulus decrements. These results suggest that the ability of ORNs to encode temporal patterns of stimulation increases the coding capacity of the olfactory circuit. Moreover, the ability of ORNs to sense stimulus increments and decrements facilitates instantaneous evaluations of concentration changes in the environment. Together, these ORN properties enable larvae to efficiently navigate a complex olfactory environment. Ultimately, knowledge of how ORN activity patterns and their weighted contributions influence odor coding may eventually reveal how peripheral information is organized and transmitted to subsequent layers of a neural circuit.", "title": "Behavior Responses to Chemical and Optogenetic Stimuli in Drosophila Larvae"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-12-21T04:49:01Z", "id": "00006db0d69641b7bad178b7e182db74"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:12:39Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5161", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnhum.2017.00186", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "11", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/human-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5161"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience"}, "month": "04", "keywords": ["sensory substitution", "tongue", "somatosensation", "receptive fields", "bioengineering", "human"], "year": "2017", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

One solution, called sensory substitution, is to use another sensory system to bring lost information to the brain. This approach often involves the use of bioengineered devices that electrically stimulate somatosensory fibers. Interestingly, the tongue is an ideal location for electrotactile stimulation due to its dense innervation, moisture, and protected environment. Success with transmitting visual and vestibular information through the tongue indicates promise for future applications. However, sensitivity and discrimination ability varies between individuals and across the tongue surface complicating efforts to produce reliable and consistent sensations. The goals of the present study were to investigate these differences more precisely to better understand the mechanosensory innervation of the tongue so that future electrotactile devices can be designed more effectively. Specifically, we tested whether stimulation of certain regions of the tongue consistently result in better perception, whether the spacing of stimulating electrodes affects perceived intensity, and whether the orientation of electrodes affects perceived intensity and discrimination. To test these hypotheses, we built a custom tongue stimulation device, recruited 25 participants, and collected perceived intensity and discrimination data. We then subjected the data to thorough statistical analyses. Consistent with previous studies, we found that stimulation of the anterior medial tongue region was perceived as more intense than stimulation of lateral and posterior regions. This region also had the best discrimination ability for electrodes. Dividing the stimulated tongue area into 16 distinct regions allowed us to compare perception ability between anterior and posterior regions, medial and lateral regions, and the left and right sides of the tongue. Stimulation of the most anterior and medial tongue resulted in the highest perceived intensity and the best discrimination ability. Most individuals were able to perceive and discriminate electrotactile stimulation better on one side of the tongue, and orientation of stimulating electrodes affected perception. In conclusion, the present studies reveal new information about the somatosensory innervation of the tongue and will assist the design of future electrotactile tongue stimulation devices that will help provide sensory information to people with damaged sensory systems.", "title": "Perceived Intensity and Discrimination Ability for Lingual Electrotactile Stimulation Depends on Location and Orientation of Electrodes"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2017-04-21T13:08:39Z", "id": "0002fc7ad9d845859a968c81130104de"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:02:30Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5153", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00119", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "7", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.frontiersin.org/behavioral_neuroscience/about"}], "issns": ["1662-5153"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience"}, "month": "9", "keywords": ["Anxiety", "Dopamine", "ventral hippocampus", "neudesin", "bed nucleus of the stria terminalis."], "year": "2013", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

The absence of neudesin leads to an anxious-like behavior as assessed in the elevated plus maze, light/dark box and novelty suppressed feeding tests, but not in the acoustic startle test. This anxious phenotype is associated with reduced dopaminergic input and impoverished dendritic arborizations in the dentate gyrus granule neurons of the ventral hippocampus.

The article is based on a multifaceted ethnographic material that maps the experiences of biomedical research among patients with Parkinson\u2019s. The main body of material consists of interviews carried out in 2012 and 2015, and comprises 19 transcripts of recorded conversations, conducted in groups as well as individually. The article argues that the exposure of the patients to clinical neuroscience gives birth to neuroculture. A materialist-discursive phenomenon called brain world\u2014perceptions and enactments of the brain\u2014is problematized on the basis of how patients cope with and reflect on their chronic illness in everyday life situations and in confrontation with clinical neuroscience. The embodied experience of the illness operates as the route into the brain world and also becomes the ground for how this world is featured with specific properties. Brain world is in this respect a contradictory entity: both plastic and fragile, both accessible and too complex, both strange and known.

We have shown that APA acts as an antihypertensive agent in the pregnant spontaneously hypertensive rat by degrading vasoactive peptides and as a result returns the animal to a normotensive state. P-LAP also acts as an antiuterotonic agent by degrading uterotonic peptides and thus prolongs gestation in the pregnant mouse.

The difference between successful REs (S-REs) and unsuccessful REs (US-REs) is still unknown. This is the first study to compare the fMRI reactivity among US-REs, S-REs and unrestrained eaters (UREs) in a food-related Go/NoGo paradigm.Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the neural responses corresponding to the success of dieting in REs. Eighteen S-REs, 17 US-REs and 17 UREs were asked to perform a Go/No-Go task after being shown pictures of either high-caloric or low-caloric food.Results: fMRI results revealed stronger activations for high-caloric food in areas associated with executive function and inhibition (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum) among S-REs than among US-REs. In contrast, both US-REs and UREs showed stronger activations for low-caloric food in reward areas (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) than S-REs.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that food temptations may trigger processes of successful inhibition control in S-REs, whereas US-REs may fail in resisting the attraction to high-caloric food, thereby showing a high probability of overeating.Keywords: successful and unsuccessful restrained eaters, measurement of restrained eating, inhibition control, fMRI", "title": "Why Do Most Restrained Eaters Fail in Losing Weight?: Evidence from an fMRI Study", "journal": {"volume": "Volume 12", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC", "type": "CC BY-NC", "url": "http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045"}], "issns": ["1179-1578"], "publisher": "Dove Medical Press", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Psychology Research and Behavior Management"}, "month": "12", "start_page": "1127"}, "id": "0006c1a586224b08b991fcc27ee17c33", "created_date": "2019-12-19T18:45:13Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:20:18Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2235-2988", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fcimb.2014.00147", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "4", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/cellular-and-infection-microbiology#about"}], "issns": ["2235-2988"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["Symbiosis", "epigenetics", "non-coding RNA", "microbiota", "neurodevelopment", "microbiome"], "year": "2014", "subject": [{"code": "QR1-502", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Microbiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Roman M Stilling"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Roman M Stilling"}, {"affiliation": "Vanderbilt University", "name": "Seth R Bordenstein"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Timothy G Dinan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "Timothy G Dinan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "John F Cryan"}, {"affiliation": "University College Cork", "name": "John F Cryan"}], "link": [{"content_type": "HTML", "type": "fulltext", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fcimb.2014.00147/full"}], "abstract": "The tight association of the human body with trillions of colonizing microbes that we observe today is the result of a long evolutionary history.

More than 2 billion people have been exposed to HBV, and about 257 million individuals are chronic carriers of HBV. HBV reactivation has been increasingly reported in HBV carriers who have undergone immunosuppression or chemotherapy, resulting in mortality. Treatment of hypothalamic/pituitary tumors in HBV carriers requires extensive care to avoid HBV reactivation as steroid therapy is required after surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors. Case presentation This retrospective review identified 5 patients, who were HBV carriers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen among 1352 patients with surgically treated hypothalamic/pituitary tumor in Kohnan Hospital between February 2007 and April 2017. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed with particular attention to prevent damage to the pituitary gland, with delicate manipulation to minimize postoperative steroid coverage. All patients received nucleot(s)ide analogue to control HBV-DNA levels before the surgery. As a result, all patients had a good clinical course. Blood examinations found a transient increase of liver enzymes and HBV-DNA levels in all patients, which started to decrease within 2\u2009weeks after surgery. No specific treatment other than nucleot(s)ide analogues was needed to maintain liver function, and all patients returned to their previous activities including reinstatement. Conclusion Initiation of nucleot(s)ide analogues administration prior to the surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors can be an effective strategy for preventing reactivation in HBV carriers. Appropriate screening of the patient\u2019s HBV phase, optimal timing of nucleot(s)ide analogues -administration, and administration period of nucleot(s)ide analogues need to be established.", "title": "Case reports of latent HBV hepatitis in patients after neurosurgical treatment for hypothalamic and pituitary tumors", "journal": {"volume": "20", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["1471-2334"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Infectious Diseases"}, "month": "3", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0008f27334a84e51b2dad837ed23f1e5", "created_date": "2020-03-20T17:54:21Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:29:00Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5161", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnhum.2018.00288", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/human-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5161"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience"}, "month": "7", "keywords": ["posture", "dual-tasking", "cognitive-motor interference", "cognitive workload", "pupillometry", "healthy young"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Pupillometry has been used to quantify cognitive workload of various cognitive tasks, but has not been studied in postural control. The current investigation utilized pupillometry to quantify the cognitive workload of postural control in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that cognitive workload, indexed by pupil size, will increase with challenging postural control conditions including visual occlusion and cognitive dual tasking.Methods: Twenty-one young healthy adults (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean), (age = 23.2 \u00b1 0.49 years; 12 females) were recruited for this study. Participants completed four tasks: (1) standing with eyes open; (2) standing with eyes occluded (3) standing with eyes open while performing an auditory Stroop task; and (4) standing with eyes occluded while performing an auditory Stroop task. Participants wore eye tracking glasses while standing on a force platform. The eye tracking glasses recorded changes in pupil size that in turn were converted into the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA). ICA values were averaged for each eye and condition. A two-way Analysis of Variance with post-hoc Sidak correction for pairwise comparisons was run to examine the effect of visual occlusion and dual tasking on ICA values as well on Center of Pressure (CoP) sway velocity in anterior\u2013posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions. A Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was utilized to determine the relationship between ICA values and CoP sway velocity.Results: Significant within-condition effect was observed with visual occlusion for the right eye ICA values (p = 0.008). Right eye ICA increased from eyes open to eyes occluded conditions (p = 0.008). In addition, a significant inverse correlation was observed between right eye ICA values and CoP sway velocity in the ML direction across all the conditions (r = -0.25, p = 0.02).Conclusion: This study demonstrated support for increased cognitive workload, measured by pupillometry, as a result of changes in postural control in healthy young adults.

The aims of this study were: 1) to compare perceived attachment security and anxiety in children and adolescents with migraine without aura and a healthy control group; 2) to test whether the child\u2019s perceived security of attachment to the mother and the father mediated the association between migraine and anxiety. Methods One hundred children and adolescents with Migraine without Aura were compared with a control group of 100 children without headache. The Security Scale (measures perceived security of attachments) and the Self-Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents, a measure of anxiety symptoms, were administered to all participants. Results The clinical group had lower attachment security than the control group and higher scores on all anxiety scales. Anxiety was negatively correlated with attachment. Children\u2019s attachment to their mother mediated the increase in global anxiety in the clinical group. Insecure paternal attachment was associated with greater insecurity in maternal attachment, suggesting that there is a complex pathway from migraine to anxiety symptoms mediated by perceived insecurity of paternal attachment and hence also by perceived insecurity of maternal attachment.

However, this study shows that both espresso and instant coffee brews did not present immunostimulatory neither anti-inflammatory in vitro activities.

Therefore, the proposed molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective role and its preconditions are reviewed in this paper, with emphases on the mTOR pathway and the relationship between the expression of hamartin and DNA methylation.", "title": "Hamartin: An Endogenous Neuroprotective Molecule Induced by Hypoxic Preconditioning"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "000f9d2d84b24e9395cd891b191973b4", "created_date": "2020-09-30T16:27:08Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:21:53Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2008-126X", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2228-7442", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "35", "keywords": ["Bipolar Spectrum Disorders", " Social Network", " Bonacich Power", " Centrality."], "year": "2012", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Thus, NSC transplantation may represent an effective therapeutic strategy.

Understanding and modulating these aspects can allow us to further exploit the therapeutic potential of NSCs.

We used a microfluidic chamber driven with a high-speed pressure servo to generate defined fluid shear stress to cultured astrocytes, and simultaneously measured cytoskeletal forces using a force sensitive actinin optical sensor and intracellular Ca2+. Fluid shear generated non-uniform forces in actinin that critically depended on the stimulus rise time emphasizing the presence of viscoelasticity in the activating sequence. A short (ms) shear pulse with fast rise time (2 ms) produced an immediate increase in actinin tension at the upstream end of the cell with minimal changes at the downstream end. The onset of Ca2+ rise began at highly strained areas. In contrast to stimulus steps, slow ramp stimuli produced uniform forces throughout the cells and only a small Ca2+ response. The heterogeneity of force distribution is exaggerated in cells having fewer stress fibers and lower pre-tension in actinin. Disruption of cytoskeleton with cytochalasin-D (Cyt-D) eliminated force gradients, and in those cells Ca2+ elevation started from the soma.

The identification of addiction resilience factors is a potential strategy to identify new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically.

Heparan sulfate modulates the activity and distribution of a set of negatively charged signaling peptides and proteins \u2014 known as the HS interactome \u2014 by acting as a co-receptor or alternative receptor for growth factors and other signaling peptides and sequestering and localizing them, among other actions. Here, we show that stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine greatly increase HS content and sulfation levels in the lateral hypothalamus and that HS contributes to the regulation of cocaine seeking and taking. The ability of the HS-binding neuropeptide glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to increase cocaine intake was potentiated by a deletion that abolished its HS binding. The delivery of heparanase, the endo-\u03b2-D-glucuronidase that degrades HS, accelerated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and promoted persistent responding during extinction.

These alterations include abnormalities in brain size and growth that begin prenatally and persist postnatally.

We aimed to evaluate the trajectory of brain growth in a cohort of patients with complex CHD (n\u202f=\u202f16) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f15) to test the hypothesis that patients with complex CHD would have smaller total brain volume (TBV) prenatally, which would become increasingly prominent by three months of age. Participants underwent fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a mean of 32\u202fweeks gestation, a preoperative/neonatal MRI shortly after birth, a postoperative MRI (CHD only), and a 3-month MRI to evaluate the trajectory of brain growth. Three-dimensional volumetric analysis was applied to the MRI data to measure TBV, as well as tissue-specific volumes of the cortical gray matter (CGM), white matter (WM), subcortical (deep nuclear) gray matter (SCGM), cerebellum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A random coefficients model was used to investigate longitudinal changes in TBV and demonstrated an altered trajectory of brain growth in the CHD population. The estimated slope for TBV from fetal to 3-month MRI was 11.5\u202fcm3 per week for CHD infants compared to 16.7\u202fcm3 per week for controls (p\u202f=\u202f0.0002). Brain growth followed a similar trajectory for the CGM (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), SCGM (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and cerebellum (p\u202f=\u202f0.005). There was no difference in growth of the WM (p\u202f=\u202f0.30) or CSF (p\u202f=\u202f0.085). Brain injury was associated with reduced TBV at 3-month MRI (p\u202f=\u202f0.02). After removing infants with brain injury from the model, an altered trajectory of brain growth persisted in CHD infants (p\u202f=\u202f0.006). These findings extend the existing literature by demonstrating longitudinal impairments in brain development in the CHD population and emphasize the global nature of disrupted brain growth from the prenatal environment through early infancy.

Uncoupling of energy sensing and behavior, however, underlies energy balance disorders such as anorexia or obesity.  The hypothalamus regulates energy balance, and in particular the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is poised to coordinate peripheral cues of energy status and behaviors that impact weight, such as drinking, locomotor behavior, arousal/sleep and autonomic output.  There are several populations of LHA neurons that are defined by their neuropeptide content and contribute to energy balance.  LHA neurons that express the neuropeptides melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) or orexins/hypocretins (OX) are best characterized and these neurons play important roles in regulating ingestion, arousal, locomotor behavior and autonomic function via distinct neuronal circuits.

Understanding the specific roles of MCH, OX and Nts neurons in harmonizing energy sensing and behavior thus has the potential to inform pharmacological strategies to modify behaviors and treat energy balance disorders.", "title": "To Ingest or Rest?

To date, few studies have used neurophysiological measures in combination to subjective measures to assess cognitive workload during a walking task. This combined approach can provide more insights into the amount of cognitive resources in relation with the perceived mental effort involving in a walking task.Research Question: The objective was to examine cognitive workload in young adults during walking conditions varying in complexity.Methods: Twenty-five young adults (mean = 24.4 \u00b1 5.4) performed four conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) simple DT walking, (3) complex DT walking and (4) standing while subtracting. During the walking task, mean speed, cadence, stride time, stride length, and their respective coefficient of variation (CV) were recorded. Cognitive workload will be measured through changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (\u0394HbO2 and \u0394HbR) during walking in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and perceived mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire.Results: In young adults, \u0394HbO2 in the DLPFC increased from usual walking to both DT walking conditions and standing while subtracting condition. \u0394HbO2 did not differ between the simple and complex DT and between the complex DT and standing while subtracting condition. Perceived mental demand gradually increased with walking task complexity. As expected, all mean values of gait parameters were altered according to task complexity. CV of speed, cadence and stride time were significantly higher during DT walking conditions than during usual walking whereas CV of stride length was only higher during complex DT walking than during usual walking.Significance: Young adults had greater cognitive workload in the two DT walking conditions compared to usual walking. However, only the mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire discriminated simple from complex DT walking. Subjective measure provides complementary information to objective one on changes in cognitive workload during challenging walking tasks in young adults. These results may be useful to improve our understanding of cognitive workload during walking.", "title": "Measuring the Cognitive Workload During Dual-Task Walking in Young Adults: A Combination of Neurophysiological and Subjective Measures"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "001e47ea09924ea0b83e782a0b02ebcd", "created_date": "2020-11-20T05:25:23Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:42:06Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/1471-2202-8-S2-P138", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "1471-2202", "type": "pissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "8", "number": "Suppl 2", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/about"}], "issns": ["1471-2202"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Neuroscience"}, "month": "7", "year": "2007", "start_page": "P138", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

One mechanism by which anesthesia may impair cognition is by decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Several studies have seen a reduction in cell survival after anesthesia in rodents with most studies focusing on two particularly vulnerable age windows: the neonatal period and old age. However, the extent to which sedation affects neurogenesis in young adults remains unclear. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) was analyzed in male and female rats 24 h after a 4-h period of sedation with isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or dexmedetomidine. Three different cell populations were quantified: cells that were 1 week or 1 month old, labeled with the permanent birthdate markers EdU or BrdU, respectively, and precursor cells, identified by their expression of the endogenous dividing cell marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at the time of sacrifice. Midazolam and dexmedetomidine reduced cell proliferation in the adult DG in both sexes but had no effect on postmitotic cells. Propofol reduced the number of relatively mature, 28-day old, neurons specifically in female rats and had no effects on younger cells. Isoflurane had no detectable effects on any of the cell populations examined. These findings show no general effect of sedation on adult-born neurons but demonstrate that certain sedatives do have drug-specific and sex-specific effects. The impacts observed on different cell populations predict that any cognitive effects of these sedatives would likely occur at different times, with propofol producing a rapid but short-lived impairment and midazolam and dexmedetomidine altering cognition after a several week delay. Taken together, these studies lend support to the hypothesis that decreased neurogenesis in the young adult DG may mediate the effects of sedation on cognitive function.", "title": "The Effects of Anesthesia on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "001eed5ebd13427f8e4527de781be45a", "created_date": "2020-10-22T15:52:09Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:29:12Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2067-3957", "type": "pissn"}], "end_page": "177", "keywords": ["gait, modelling, bio-behavior, LifeMOD, rehabilitation"], "year": "2011", "subject": [{"code": "RC346-429", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurology.

Correlational evidence suggests that tone-deafness and dyslexia tend to co-occur, suggesting a link between these two developmental disorders. However, it is not known whether tone-deafness can also be associated with other developmental disorders such as impaired face recognition or prosopagnosia. We addressed this question by assessing face perception abilities in a group of tone-deaf individuals and matched non-tone-deaf subjects. The Cambridge (CFMT) and the Warrington (WRMT) face memory tests were used to assess face processing in the combined group of 12, out of which six tested in the tone-deaf range. Only tone-deaf participants (two out of six) scored in the impaired range on the CFMT, one of whom was also impaired on the WRMT face memory test. Furthermore, the melodic composite score of all participants on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia significantly correlated with their face recognition score on the CFMT. Our results suggest that in some cases tone-deafness might co-occur with face recognition impairments. It is implausible that both deficits are linked to a single cognitive dysfunction that spans different perceptual systems in different modalities.

The amazing part is that such a multisensory integration brings all information into a unified percept. An approach to start investigating this property is to show that perception is better and faster when multimodal stimuli are used as compared to unimodal stimuli. This forms the first part of the present study conducted in a non-human primate\u2019s model (n=2) engaged in a detection sensory-motor task where visual and auditory stimuli were displayed individually or simultaneously. The measured parameters were the reaction time (RT) between stimulus and onset of arm movement, successes and errors percentages, as well as the evolution as a function of time of these parameters with training. As expected, RTs were shorter when the subjects were exposed to combined stimuli. The gains for both subjects were around 20 and 40 msec, as compared with the auditory and visual stimulus alone, respectively. Moreover the number of correct responses increased in response to bimodal stimuli. We interpreted such multisensory advantage through redundant signal effect which decreases perceptual ambiguity, increases speed of stimulus detection and improves performance accuracy.The second part of the study presents single unit recordings derived from the premotor cortex (PM) of the same subjects during the sensory-motor task. Response patterns to sensory/multisensory stimulation are documented and specific type proportions are reported. Characterization of bimodal neurons indicates a mechanism of audio-visual integration possibly through a decrease of inhibition.

To fully understand which role this idiosyncrasy plays in the neurobiological mechanisms behind OCD, it is necessary to elucidate the impact of individualization regarding the applied investigation methods.This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explores the neural correlates of contamination/washing-related OCD with a highly individualized symptom provocation paradigm. Additionally, it is the first study to directly compare individualized and standardized symptom provocation. MethodsNineteen patients with washing compulsions created individual OCD hierarchies, which later served as instructions to photograph their own individualized stimulus sets. The patients and 19 case-by-case matched healthy controls participated in a symptom provocation fMRI experiment with individualized and standardized stimulus sets created for each patient. ResultsOCD patients compared to healthy controls displayed stronger activation in the basal ganglia (nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, pallidum) for individualized symptom provocation.

The direct comparison of between-group effects for both symptom provocation approaches revealed stronger activation of the orbitofronto-striatal network for individualized symptom provocation.ConclusionsThe present study provides insight into the differential impact of individualized and standardized symptom provocation on the orbitofronto-striatal network of OCD washers.

Apparently only people who have that ability. Animals also communicate, but do not use the language, at least, are not as effective as human language. Humans use language not only to communicate but also to other things, such as man can cure himself of the disease in misery with positive thinking. They also determine the attitude, spirit, ideals, hopes, and their establishment in the language, which is then stored as a memory in the brain there. In addition, human blessed with multiple intelligences and three ways of thinking (psychological, emotional, mental or spiritual). The implications of all this for learning, and even education as a whole, is very large. At best a teacher would not work membelajarkan students, if the students did not want membelajarkan himself.

Much of the work on animal foraging has focused on factors relating to the amount of time and energy animals expend searching for and harvesting foods.  Models that emphasize such factors have been invaluable in determining when it is beneficial for an animal to search for pastures new.  When foraging, however, animals also have to determine how to direct their search.  For what food should they forage?  There is no point searching for more of a particular food when you are sated from eating it.  Here we review work in macaques and humans that has sought to reveal the neural circuits critical for determining the subjective value of different foods and associated objects in our environment and tracking this value over time.  There is mounting evidence that a network composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala and medial thalamus is critical for linking objects in the environment with food value and adjusting those valuations in real time based on current biological needs.  Temporal inactivation studies have revealed that the amygdala and OFC play distinct, but complementary roles in this valuation process.  Such a network for determining the subjective value of different foods and, by extension, associated objects, must interact with systems that determine where and for how long to forage.

In many models, we face an intricate interplay between the topology of the network and the dynamics of the system, which is generally very hard to disentangle. A dynamical feature that has been subject of intense research in various fields are correlations between the noisy activity of nodes in a network. We consider a class of systems, where discrete signals are sent along the links of the network. Such systems are of particular relevance in neuroscience, because they provide models for networks of neurons that use action potentials for communication. We study correlations in dynamic networks with arbitrary topology, assuming linear pulse coupling. With our novel approach, we are able to understand in detail how specific structural motifs affect pairwise correlations. Based on a power series decomposition of the covariance matrix, we describe the conditions under which very indirect interactions will have a pronounced effect on correlations and population dynamics. In random networks, we find that indirect interactions may lead to a broad distribution of activation levels with low average but highly variable correlations. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in networks with distance dependent connectivity. In contrast, networks with highly connected hubs or patchy connections often exhibit strong average correlations.

To generate an optimal behavioral output, the nervous system must process sensory information and generate a directed motor output in response to stimuli. The nervous system should also store information about experiences to use in the future. The diverse group of free-living nematodes provides an excellent system to study macro- and microevolution of molecular, morphological and behavioral character states associated with such nervous system function. We asked whether an adaptive behavior would vary among bacterivorous nematodes and whether differences in the neurotransmitter systems known to regulate the behavior in one species would reflect differences seen in the adaptive behavior among those species. <it>Caenorhabditis elegans </it>worms slow in the presence of food; this 'basal' slowing is triggered by dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons that detect bacteria.

Like many patients with anxiety disorders, individuals with elevated levels of dispositional anxiety are prone to intrusive and distressing thoughts in the absence of immediate threat. Recent electrophysiological research suggests that these symptoms are rooted in the mis-allocation of working memory (WM) resources to threat-related information. Here, functional MRI was used to identify the network of brain regions that support WM for faces and to quantify the allocation of neural resources to threat-related distracters in 81 young adults. Results revealed widespread evidence of mis-allocation. This was evident in both face-selective regions of the fusiform cortex and domain-general regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortices. This bias was exaggerated among individuals with a more anxious disposition. Mediation analyses provided compelling evidence that anxious individuals\u2019 tendency to mis-allocate WM resources to threat-related distracters is statistically explained by heightened amygdala reactivity.

Correct performance was rewarded in 75 % of the trials.  Monkeys were certain that they would be rewarded only in the trials immediately following withheld rewards. In these trials, the animals responded sooner and moved faster. Single-unit recordings from the dorsal striatum revealed that modulations in striatal neurons reflected such modulations of movement vigor. First, in the trials with certain rewards, striatal neurons modulated their firing rates earlier. Second, magnitudes of changes in neuronal firing rates depended on whether or not monkeys were certain about the reward. Third, these modulations depended on the sensory modality of the cue (visual vs. vibratory) and/or movement direction (flexions vs. extensions).

However, the role of microvascular homeostasis as a pathogenic substrate to disturbed microperfusion as well as an overlapping etiologic mechanism between AD and ischemia has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we employ temporal histopathology of cerebral vasculature in a rat model of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) toxicity and endothelin-1 induced-ischemia (ET1) to investigate the panorama of cerebral pathology and the protein expression on d1, d7, and d28 post-injury. The combination of A\u03b2 and ET1 pathological states leads to an alteration in microvascular anatomy, texture, diameter, density, and protein expression, in addition to disturbed vessel-matrix-connections, inter-compartmental water exchange and basement membrane profile within the lesion epicenter localized in the striatum of A\u03b2+ET1 brains compared to A\u03b2 and ET1 rats. We conclude that the neural microvascular network, in addition to the neural tissue, is not only sensitive to structural deterioration but also serves as an underlying vascular etiology between ischemia and AD pathologies. Such investigation can provide prospects to appreciate the interrelationships between structure and responses of cerebral microvasculature and to provide a venue for vascular remodeling as a new treatment strategy.", "title": "Pathological Changes in Microvascular Morphology, Density, Size and Responses Following Comorbid Cerebral Injury"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-03-27T04:14:18Z", "id": "0032e8f75269402b833129710167fb72"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:50:48Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1932-6203", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0119932", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "10", "number": "3", "country": "US", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license"}], "issns": ["1932-6203"], "publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "month": "0", "year": "2015", "start_page": "e0119932", "subject": [{"code": "R", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine"}, {"code": "Q", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science"}], "author": [{"name": "Seong Yong Lim"}, {"name": "Yeu-Sheng Tyan"}, {"name": "Yi-Ping Chao"}, {"name": "Fang-Yu Nien"}, {"name": "Jun-Cheng Weng"}], "link": [{"type": "fulltext", "url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4370884?pdf=render"}], "abstract": "The use of modern neuroimaging methods to characterize the complex anatomy of brain development at different stages reveals an enormous wealth of information in understanding this highly ordered process and provides clues to detect neurological and neurobehavioral disorders that have their origin in early structural and functional cerebral maturation. Non-invasive diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is able to distinguish cerebral microscopic structures, especially in the white matter regions. However, DTI is unable to resolve the complicated neural structure, i.e., the fiber crossing that is frequently observed during the maturation process. To overcome this limitation, several methods have been proposed. One such method, generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), can be applied to a variety of datasets, including the single shell, multi-shell or grid sampling schemes that are believed to be able to resolve the complicated crossing fibers. Rabbits have been widely used for neurodevelopment research because they exhibit human-like timing of perinatal brain white matter maturation. Here, we present a longitudinal study using both DTI and GQI to demonstrate the changes in cerebral maturation of in vivo developing rabbit brains over a period of 40 weeks. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI and generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) of GQI indices demonstrated that the white matter anisotropy increased with age, with GFA exhibiting an increase in the hippocampus as well. Normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA) of GQI also revealed an increase in the hippocampus, allowing us to observe the changes in gray matter as well. Regional and whole brain DTI tractography also demonstrated refinement in fiber pathway architecture with maturation. We concluded that DTI and GQI results were able to characterize the white matter anisotropy changes, whereas GQI provided further information about the gray matter hippocampus area. This developing rabbit brain DTI and GQI database could also be used for educational purposes and neuroscience investigations.", "title": "New insights into the developing rabbit brain using diffusion tensor tractography and generalized q-sampling MRI."}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T05:26:20Z", "id": "00335a9c1a5845e3a6b5e989527b2d3b"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:17:50Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2005-0348", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2508-1349", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.18700/jnc.160101", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "112", "keywords": ["Intracranial pressure", "Intracranial hypertension", "Cerebral perfusion pressure", "Cerebral blood flow", "Hypothermia", "Osmotic agents"], "year": "2016", "subject": [{"code": "RC346-429", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurology.

The aim of the study was to explore the socio-economic status of households with a person with severe mental disorder (SMD; psychosis or bipolar disorder) or depression compared to households without an affected person. Methods A population-based, comparative, cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Sodo district, south Ethiopia, between January and November 2015. Two samples were recruited, each with its own comparison group. Sample (1): households of 290 community-ascertained persons with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of SMD and a comparison group of 289 households without a person with SMD. Sample (2): households of 128 people who attended the primary health care centre and who were identified by primary care staff as having a probable diagnosis of depressive disorder; and comparison households of 129 patients who attended for other reasons and who did not receive a diagnosis of depression. Household socioeconomic status (household income, consumption and asset-based wealth) was assessed using a contextualized version of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) questionnaire. Each disorder group (SMD and depression) was further divided into higher and lower disability groups on the basis of median score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Results Households of a person with SMD who had higher disability were more likely to have a poorer living standard (no toilet facility; p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Having a reliable source of regular income was significantly lower in households of a person with SMD (p\u00a0=\u20090.008) or depression (p\u00a0=\u20090.046) with higher disability than the comparison group. Households of persons with SMD with higher disability earned less (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and owned significantly fewer assets (p\u2009<\u20090.001) than households without SMD. Households including persons with depression who had higher disability had lower income (p\u2009=\u20090.042) and reduced consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Conclusions Households with a member who had either SMD or depression were socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to the general population. Moreover, higher disability was associated with worse socio-economic disadvantage. Prospective studies are needed to determine the direction of association. This study indicates a need to consider households of people with SMD or depression as a vulnerable group requiring economic support alongside access to evidence-based mental healthcare.", "title": "Mental health problems and socioeconomic disadvantage: a controlled household study in rural Ethiopia", "journal": {"volume": "18", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/copyright-and-license"}], "issns": ["1475-9276"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "International Journal for Equity in Health"}, "month": "7", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "003418852a0b49b1b7b2923bfa1b9a01", "created_date": "2019-08-04T12:35:09Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:02:31Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5102", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fncel.2015.00414", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.frontiersin.org/cellular_neuroscience/about"}], "issns": ["1662-5102"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["Astrocytes", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Microglia", "Neuroinflammation", "vasculature", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"], "year": "2015", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

TC cells encode deflection velocity through population synchrony, while deflection direction is encoded through the distribution of spike counts across the TC population. Barrel RS cells encode both deflection direction and velocity with spike rate, and are divided into functional domains by direction preference.

How neuronal projections find their targets to generate appropriate synapses is not entirely understood. Although transcription factors are key molecules during neurogenesis, we do not know their entire function during the formation of networks in the CNS. Here, we used the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe as a model for understanding neurite guidance during development. We assessed the function of Sox102F/SoxD, the unique Drosophila orthologue of the vertebrate SoxD family of transcription factors. SoxD is expressed in immature and mature neurons in the larval and adult lobula plate ganglia (one of the optic lobe neuropils), but is absent from glial cells, neural stem cells and progenitors of the lobula plate. SoxD RNAi knockdown in all neurons results in a reduction of the lobula plate neuropil, without affecting neuronal fate. This morphological defect is associated with an impaired optomotor response of adult flies. Moreover, knocking down SoxD only in T4/T5 neuronal types, which control motion vision, affects proper neurite guidance into the medulla and lobula.

Dopamine signaling may impact neuronal activity by modulation of glutamate neurotransmission. Recent evidence indicates a direct and/or indirect involvement of fragile X-related family proteins (FXR) in the regulation and mediation of dopamine receptor functions. FXRs consists of fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (Fmr1/FMRP) and its autosomal homologs Fxr1 and Fxr2. These RNA-binding proteins are enriched in the brain. Loss of function mutation in human FMR1 is the major genetic contributor to Fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Therefore, the role of FXR proteins has mostly been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders. However, recent genome-wide association studies have linked this family to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and mood regulation pointing toward a broader involvement in mental illnesses. FXR family proteins play an important role in the regulation of glutamate-mediated neuronal activity and plasticity. Here, we discuss the brain-specific functions of FXR family proteins by focusing on the regulation of dopamine receptor functions, ionotropic glutamate receptors-mediated synaptic plasticity and contribution to mental illnesses.

The SERPINE1 gene that encodes PAI\u20101 for the regulation of tissue plasminogen activator is considered an important therapeutic target for aSAH. Methods Six SNPs in the SERPINE1 gene (in order of rs2227631, rs1799889, rs6092, rs6090, rs2227684, rs7242) were investigated. Blood samples were genotyped with Taqman genotyping assays and pyrosequencing. The experiment\u2010wide statistically significant threshold for single marker analysis was set at p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 after evaluation of independent markers. Haplotype analysis was performed in Haplo.stats package with permutation tests. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison in dominant, additive, and recessive model was applied. Results A total of 146 aSAH patients and 49 control subjects were involved in this study. The rs2227631 G allele is significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) for aSAH compared to control.

Furthermore, weight loss interventions such as voluntary physical activity (PA) for adults with obesity or overweight was reported to promote pain reduction in humans with chronic pain. However, regardless of obesity status, it is not known whether HFD intake and sedentary (SED) behavior is underlies chronic pain susceptibility. Moreover, differential gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a crucial role in chronic pain susceptibility. Thus, the present study used an adapted model of the inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced persistent hyperalgesia short-term (PH-ST) protocol for mice, an HFD, and a voluntary PA paradigm to test these hypotheses. Therefore, we performed an analysis of differential gene expression using a transcriptome approach of the NAc. We also applied a gene ontology enrichment tools to identify biological processes associated with chronic pain susceptibility and to investigate the interaction between the factors studied: diet (standard diet vs. HFD), physical activity behavior (SED vs. PA) and PH-ST (PGE vs. saline). Our results demonstrated that HFD intake and sedentary behavior promoted chronic pain susceptibility, which in turn was prevented by voluntary physical activity, even when the animals were fed an HFD. The transcriptome of the NAc found 2,204 differential expression genes and gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed 41 biologic processes implicated in chronic pain susceptibility. Taking these biological processes together, our results suggest that genes related to metabolic and mitochondria stress were up-regulated in the chronic pain susceptibility group (SED-HFD-PGE), whereas genes related to neuroplasticity were up-regulated in the non-chronic pain susceptibility group (PA-HFD-PGE). These findings provide pieces of evidence that HFD intake and sedentary behavior provoked gene expression changes in the NAc related to promotion of chronic pain susceptibility, whereas voluntary physical activity provoked gene expression changes in the NAc related to prevention of chronic pain susceptibility. Finally, our findings confirmed previous literature supporting the crucial role of voluntary physical activity to prevent chronic pain and suggest that low levels of voluntary physical activity would be helpful and highly recommended as a complementary treatment for those with chronic pain.", "title": "Physical Activity Induces Nucleus Accumbens Genes Expression Changes Preventing Chronic Pain Susceptibility Promoted by High-Fat Diet and Sedentary Behavior in Mice"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "003d83b0d4d94564a8ca5cc6cc75459f", "created_date": "2020-01-22T04:56:00Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:03:11Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-453X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnins.2018.00785", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-453X", "1662-4548"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neuroscience"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["panic attacks", "CO2 exposure", "genetics", "DNA methylation", "ambulatory assessment"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks (PAs) are the primary symptom and strongly impact patients\u2019 quality of life. Clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous between patients, emphasizing the need for a dimensional classification integrating various aspects of neurobiological and psychological circuits in line with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposed by the US National Institute of Mental Health. To go beyond data that can be collected in the daily clinical situation, experimental panic provocation is widely used, which has led to important insights into involved brain regions and systems. Genetic variants can determine the sensitivity to experimental models such as carbon dioxide (CO2) exposure and can increase the risk to develop PD. Recent developments now allow to better assess the dynamic course of PAs outside the laboratory in patients\u2019 natural environment. This can provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms and the influence of environmental factors that can alter gene regulation by changing DNA methylation. In this mini review, we discuss assessment of PAs in the clinic, in the laboratory using CO2 exposure, genetic associations, and the benefits of real-life assessment and epigenetic research.", "title": "Assessing Panic: Bridging the Gap Between Fundamental Mechanisms and Daily Life Experience"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-10-24T05:40:51Z", "id": "003da0175d524d68bdee045ae9b86407"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:11:37Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1687-708X", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "1687-7098", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1155/2010/273573", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2010", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/guidelines/"}], "issns": ["1687-708X", "1687-7098"], "publisher": "Hindawi Limited", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases"}, "year": "2010", "subject": [{"code": "RC109-216", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Infectious and parasitic diseases"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, National Institute of Neuroscience and Neuroscience Center, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 23, 44100 Ferrara, Italy", "name": "Carlo Contini"}, {"affiliation": "Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, National Institute of Neuroscience and Neuroscience Center, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 23, 44100 Ferrara, Italy", "name": "Silva Seraceni"}, {"affiliation": "Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, National Institute of Neuroscience and Neuroscience Center, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 23, 44100 Ferrara, Italy", "name": "Rosario Cultrera"}, {"affiliation": "Section of Neurology, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the Communication and Behaviour, Multiple Sclerosis Center, National Institute of Neuroscience and Neuroscience Center, University of Ferrara, Arcispedale S.

Motor neglect (MN) is a clinically important condition whereby patients with unilateral brain lesions fail to move their contralateral limbs, despite normal muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation. MN has been associated with various lesion sites, including the parietal and frontal cortex, the internal capsule, the lenticulostriate nuclei, and the thalamus. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that MN depends on a dysfunction of the medial motor system by performing a detailed anatomical analysis in four patients with MN.Methods. Ten patients participated in the study: four with MN, four with left visual neglect but without MN, and three patients with left hemiplegia without MN. We used specific scales for clinical and neuropsychological assessment. We drew the lesion borders directly onto the original brain images of each patient, and plotted the lesions on anatomical atlases for grey and white matter. Results. Lesion locations were highly heterogeneous in our MN patients, and included frontal and parietal sites, basal ganglia and white matter. The only consistently damaged structure across all MN patients was the cingulum bundle, a major pathway of the medial motor system important for motor initiative, and a key connection with limbic structures crucial for motivational aspects of actions. Three MN patients with additional damage to lateral fronto-parietal networks had also signs of contralesional visual neglect. The cingulum bundle was intact in all the control patients with visual neglect or hemiplegia.Conclusions. Cingulum damage may induce MN through unilateral dysfunction of the medial motor system. Additional lateral fronto-parietal dysfunction can result in the association with visual neglect.", "title": "Damage to the medial motor system in stroke patients with motor neglect"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2014-09-22T10:30:04Z", "id": "003f78f1b6b54a2dbcdbc18ca2405923"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:25:52Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-453X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnins.2018.01007", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-453X", "1662-4548"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neuroscience"}, "month": "1", "keywords": ["COMT", "catecholamine", "5-HTTLPR", "serotonin", "emotion recognition", "social cognition"], "year": "2019", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Although the COMT gene appears to induce a negativity bias during the neural processing of faces, it is currently unclear whether a similar negativity bias emerges during the behavioral processing of faces. To address this issue, we investigated differences in complex emotion recognition between participants (n = 181) that had been a priori genotyped for functional polymorphisms of the COMT (Val158Met) and serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) gene. We were, thus, able to analyze differences in face processing on basis of participants\u2019 COMT genotype while controlling for participants\u2019 5-HTTLPR genotype. Variations of participants\u2019 COMT but not 5-HTTLPR genotype accounted for differences in participants\u2019 emotion recognition performance: Met/Met carriers and Met/Val carriers were more accurate in the recognition of negative, but not neutral or positive, expressions than Val/Val carriers.

Implications for 3-d audio displays: The utility of a 3-d audio display for imparting spatial information is likely to be improved if operators are able to move their heads during signal presentation. Head movement may compensate in part for a paucity of spectral cues to sound-source location resulting from limitations in either the audio signals presented or the directional filters (i.e., head-related transfer functions) used to generate a display.

Glycated hemoglobin is currently used as the reference parameter. The accuracy of the glycated hemoglobin dosage may be compromised in subjects suffering from chronic renal failure and terminal nephropathy, affected by the reduction in the survival of erythrocytes, with consequent decrease in the time available for glucose to attach to the hemoglobin. In the presence of these renal comorbidities as well as hemoglobinopathies and pregnancy, glycated hemoglobin is not reliable. In such conditions, dosage of glycated albumin can help. Glycated albumin is not only useful for short-term diagnosis and monitoring but predicts the risk of diabetes, even in the presence of euglycemia. This protein is modified in subjects who do not yet have a glycemic alteration but, as a predictive factor, heralds the risk of diabetic disease.

The stress group received stress using a restraint cylinder (6 cm ID, 20 cm L) 60 min/day from the 1st to the 15th day of pregnancy. The control group did not receive stress. The male F1 offspring was nursed by their mothers (n=10/group) until reaching weights between 20 and 25 g. Then they were tested for spatial memory using Barnes maze and anxiety-like behavior by the elevated plus-maze. Also, brain BDNF level was measured by means of an ELISA reader.\nResults: Barnes maze test results showed that the time and distance to reach the target hole were significantly (p<0.001) increased in the stress group. Also, the number of errors and anxiety-like behavior in the stress group were significantly (p<0.001) increased compared to those in the control group (p<0.001). BDNF level in the brain was significantly (p<0.05) higher in the control group.\nConclusion: The present study indicated that prenatal stress can lead to decreased level of BDNF in the brain of the offspring which may result in spatial memory disorder and anxiety-like behavior.\nKey Words: Restraint stress, Barnes maze, Spatial memory, Anxiety-like behavior, BDNF.\n\u00a0\nReceived: Feb 17, 2018\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accepted: May 22, 2018", "title": "Effect of prenatal immobilization stress on spatial memory, anxiety-like behavior and brain BDNF concentration in the F1 generation male mice", "journal": {"volume": "23", "number": "3", "country": "IR", "issns": ["1560-652X", "2345-4040"], "publisher": " Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences", "language": ["FA"], "title": "\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u067e\u0632\u0634\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646"}, "month": "8", "start_page": "73"}, "id": "00448c684eec4633ab5bbbd7074ff566", "created_date": "2020-12-27T08:00:45Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:54:10Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-042X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fphys.2018.00558", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/physiology#about"}], "issns": ["1664-042X"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Physiology"}, "month": "5", "keywords": ["heart failure", "Akt", "cardiac hypertrophy", "cardiomyocytes", "pressure overload"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "QP1-981", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Physiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy", "name": "Gabriele G.

Alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways participate in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in LVH and HF. cAMP signals are received and integrated by a family of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) anchor proteins (AKAPs), tethering PKA to discrete cellular locations. AKAPs encoded by the Akap1 gene (mitoAKAPs) promote PKA mitochondrial targeting, regulating mitochondrial structure and function, reactive oxygen species production, and cell survival. To determine the role of mitoAKAPs in LVH development, in the present investigation, mice with global genetic deletion of Akap1 (Akap1-/-), Akap1 heterozygous (Akap1+/-), and their wild-type (wt) littermates underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or SHAM procedure for 1 week. In wt mice, pressure overload induced the downregulation of AKAP121, the major cardiac mitoAKAP. Compared to wt, Akap1-/- mice did not display basal alterations in cardiac structure or function and cardiomyocyte size or fibrosis. However, loss of Akap1 exacerbated LVH and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and accelerated the progression toward HF in TAC mice, and these changes were not observed upon prevention of AKAP121 degradation in seven in absentia homolog 2 (Siah2) knockout mice (Siah2-/-). Loss of Akap1 was also associated to a significant increase in cardiac apoptosis as well as lack of activation of Akt signaling after pressure overload. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in vivo genetic deletion of Akap1 enhances LVH development and accelerates pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction, pointing at Akap1 as a novel repressor of pathological LVH.

Our previous work has shown that T-lymphocytes exposed to elevated levels of norepinephrine (NE) displayed a pro-inflammatory signature reminiscent of an autoreactive phenotype. With this, we hypothesized that the increased sympathetic tone observed during psychological trauma may be promoting pro-inflammatory T-lymphocytes, which causes a predisposition to comorbid inflammatory conditions. Here, we examined the consequences of psychological trauma on splenic T-lymphocytes using a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress. Social defeat led to anxiety-like and depression-like behavior as has been previously described. The spleens of socially-defeated mice showed significant elevations of NE, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) levels, which appeared to be due in part to increased expression within T-lymphocytes. Additionally, T-lymphocytes from stressed animals showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial superoxide. Interestingly, in this model system, close associations exist within splenic T-lymphocytes amid the autonomic, inflammatory, and redox environments, but these only weakly correlate with individual behavioral differences among animals suggesting the psychological and physiological manifestations of trauma may not be tightly coupled. Last, we describe, for the first time, elevations in calprotectin levels within T-lymphocytes and in circulation of psychologically stressed animals. Calprotectin correlated with both behavioral and physiological changes after social defeat, suggesting the potential for a new biological marker and/or therapeutic target for psychological trauma and its inflammatory comorbidities.", "title": "Autonomic and Redox Imbalance Correlates With T-Lymphocyte Inflammation in a Model of Chronic Social Defeat Stress"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-05-14T06:20:14Z", "id": "00493a4798c84bd99264626df481005a"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:29:38Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5153", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00313", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.frontiersin.org/behavioral_neuroscience/about"}], "issns": ["1662-5153"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience"}, "month": "12", "keywords": ["music", "olfaction", "fMRI", "emotion regulation", "gender"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Researchers have advanced improvements in cerebral circulation as a mediator of long-term effects of aerobic physical exercise on cognition, but the immediate effects of exercise on cognition and cerebral perfusion are not well characterized and the effects in older adults are largely unknown. Methods: Forty-nine older adults were randomized to a 30-min aerobic exercise at moderate intensity or relaxation. Groups were matched on age and cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max). Average Grey Matter Blood Flow (GMBF), measured by a pulsed arterial-spin labeling (pASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, and working memory performance, measured by figurative n-back tasks with increasing loads were assessed before and 7\u00a0min after exercising/resting. Results: Accuracy on the n-back task increased from before to after exercising/resting regardless of the type of activity. GMBF decreased after exercise, relative to the control (resting) group. In the exercise group, higher n-back performance after exercise was associated with lower GMBF in the right hippocampus, left medial frontal cortex and right orbitofrontal cortex, and higher cardiovascular fitness was associated with lower GMBF.

High-mobility group A1 (HMGA1), well-known chromatin remodeling proteins, play pivotal roles in diverse biological processes and diseases. Their function in neural cell death in PD, however, have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that HMGA1 is highly induced during dopaminergic cell death in vitro and mice models of PD in vivo. Functional studies using genetic knockdown of endogenous HMGA1 show that HMGA1 signaling inhibition accelerates neural cell death, at least partially through aggravating MPP+-induced autophagic flux reduction resulting from partial block in autophagic flux at the terminal stages, indicating a novel potential neuroprotective role for HMGA1 in dopaminergic neurons death. MicroRNA-103/107 (miR-103/107) family, which is highly expressed in neuron, coordinately ensures proper end-stage autophagy. We further illustrate that MPP+/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced HMGA1 elevation counterparts the effect of miR-103/107 downregulation by directly binding to their promoters, respectively, sustaining their expression in MPP+-damaged MN9D cells and modulates autophagy through CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling pathway. We also find that HMGA1 is a direct target of miR-103/107 family. Thus, our results suggest that HMGA1 forms a negative feedback loop with miR-103/107-CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling to regulate the MPP+/MPTP-induced autophagy impairment and neural cell death. Collectively, we identify a paradigm for compensatory neuroprotective HMGA1 signaling in dopaminergic neurons that could have important therapeutic implications for PD.", "title": "HMGA1 Induction of miR-103/107 Forms a Negative Feedback Loop to Regulate Autophagy in MPTP Model of Parkinson\u2019s Disease"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0053f4ac923141bca0a10496451c20a5", "created_date": "2021-01-18T04:16:53Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:28:49Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-0640", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00569", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/psychiatry#about"}], "issns": ["1664-0640"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Psychiatry"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["duration discrimination", "neurodevelopment disorder", "attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)", "autism spectrum disorder (ASD)", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "comorbidity"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC435-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Psychiatry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom", "name": "Steve D.

The results evoked by multiple whisker stimulation in extracellular single unit recording showed that in Alzheimer\u2019s disease model of animals excitatory receptive field (RF) of neurons were extended but inhibitory RF was decreased (P<0.05). In addition the magnitude of neural response following principal whisker deflection decreased in cases (P<0.05).

Two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-1beta (IL-1) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) have been implicated as main effectors of the functional consequences of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration in PD models. In this review, we describe that the functional interaction between these cytokines in the brain differs from the periphery (e.g. their expression is not induced by each other) and present data showing predominantly a toxic effect of these cytokines when expressed at high doses and for a sustained period of time in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN). In addition, we highlight opposite evidence showing protective effects of these two main cytokines when conditions of duration, amount of expression or state of activation of the target or neighboring cells are changed. Furthermore, we discuss these results in the frame of previous disappointing results from anti-TNF clinical trials against Multiple Sclerosis, another neurodegenerative disease with a clear neuroinflammatory component. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the available evidence suggests that the duration and dose of IL-1 or TNF expression is crucial to predict their functional effect on the SN. Since these parameters are not amenable for measurement in the SN of PD patients, we call for an in-depth analysis to identify downstream mediators that could be common to the toxic (and not the protective) effects of these cytokines in the SN. This strategy could spare the possible neuroprotective effect of these cytokines operative in the patient at the time of treatment, increasing the probability of efficacy in a clinical setting. Alternatively, receptor-specific agonists or antagonists could also provide a way to circumvent undesired effects of general anti-inflammatory or specific anti IL-1 or TNF therapies against PD.", "title": "Interleukin-1beta and TNF-alpha: reliable targets for protective therapies in Parkinson&#180;s Disease?"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2014-05-22T09:39:56Z", "id": "005626f05b5d4fdda1bea5a525b3994f"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:10:07Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2373-7972", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.3934/Neuroscience.2018.1.81", "type": "doi"}], "end_page": "96", "keywords": ["shape recognition", "shape encoding", "visual persistence", "working memory"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Most have asked for recognition of known shapes, <em>e.g</em>., letters of the alphabet, or recall from an array. Recognition of known shapes requires access to long-term memory, so it is not possible to know whether the experiment is assessing short-term encoding and working memory mechanisms, or has encountered limitations on retrieval from memory stores. Here we have used an inventory of unknown shapes, wherein a string of discrete dots forms the boundary of each shape. Each was displayed as a target only once to a given respondent, with recognition being tested using a matching task. Analysis based on signal detection theory was used to provide an unbiased estimate of the probability of correct decisions about whether comparison shapes matched target shapes. Four experiments were conducted, which found the following: a) Shapes were identified with a high probability of being correct with dot densities ranging from 20% to 4%. Performance dropped only about 10% across this density range. b) Shape identification levels remained very high with up to 500 milliseconds of target and comparison shape separation. c) With one-at-a-time display of target dots, varying the total time for a given display, the proportion of correct decisions dropped only about 10% even with a total display time of 500 milliseconds. d) With display of two complementary target subsets, also varying the total time of each display, there was a dramatic decline of proportion correct that reached chance levels by 500 milliseconds. The greater rate of decline for the two-pulse condition may be due to a mechanism that registers when the number of dots is sufficient to create a shape summary.

In mice performing a trial-based operant task, we test if bidirectional manipulations of cue or operant-associated DA neuron activity drive learning as a result of under- or overexpectation of reward value. We target optogenetic manipulations to different components of forced trials, when only one lever is presented, and assess lever biases on choice trials in the absence of photomanipulation. Although lever biases are demonstrated to be flexible and sensitive to changes in expected value, augmentation of cue or operant-associated DA signaling does not significantly alter choice behavior, and blunting DA signaling during any component of the forced trials reduces choice trial responses on the associated lever. These data suggest cue-evoked DA helps maintain cue-value associations but does not encode expected value as to set the benchmark against which received reward is judged. : Although reward-predictive cues increase midbrain dopamine neuron activity in proportion to the expected value of the anticipated reward, Mendoza et\u00a0al. demonstrate that cue-evoked dopamine does not prospectively encode expected value as to influence reward assessment.

Collectively these findings suggest that FMRP plays critical roles in Ca2+ homeostasis during nervous system development. We carried out a functional analysis of Ca2+ regulation using a calcium imaging approach in Fmr1-KO cultured neurons and we show that these cells display impaired steady state Ca2+ concentration and an altered entry of Ca2+ after KCl-triggered depolarization. Consistent with these data, we show that the protein product of the Cacna1a gene, the pore-forming subunit of the Cav2.1 channel, is less expressed at the plasma membrane of Fmr1-KO neurons compared to wild-type (WT). Thus, our findings point out the critical role that Cav2.1 plays in the altered Ca2+ flux in Fmr1-KO neurons, impacting Ca2+ homeostasis of these cells.

Although this deep rTMS technique is being applied in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, few animal studies have attempted to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects. This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism. Adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were fed a rodent chow without or with cuprizone (CPZ; 0.2% w/w) for 5 weeks. Another two groups of mice were subjected to deep rTMS or sham rTMS once a day during weeks 2\u20135 of the CPZ-feeding period. The behaviors of all mice were assessed after the withdrawal of CPZ before neuropathological and immunological analyses. Compared to the CNT group, mice in CPZ and CPZ + Sham groups showed deficits in social recognition and spatial working memory as well as anxiety-like behavior, in addition to myelin breakdown and OL loss in the corpus callosum (CC), caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of the brain. Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice. Besides, it also dampened microglia activation at lesion sites and rectified cytokines levels (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10) in CPZ-affected regions. The most significant effect was seen in the cerebral cortex where alleviated neuropathology co-existed with less microglia activation and higher IL-10 level.

Cholesterol (Chol) localizes in both hemilayers, but in the external one it is mostly condensed in lipid-ordered microdomains (raft domains), together with saturated phosphatidyl lipids and sphingolipids (including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids). Membrane asymmetries induce special membrane biophysical properties and behave as signals for several physiological and/or pathological processes. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is associated with a perturbation in different membrane properties. Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein together with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the most characteristic cellular changes observed in this disease. The extracellular presence of A\u03b2 peptides forming senile plaques, together with soluble oligomeric species of A\u03b2, are considered the major cause of the synaptic dysfunction of AD. The association between A\u03b2 peptide and membrane lipids has been extensively studied. It has been postulated that Chol content and Chol distribution condition A\u03b2 production and posterior accumulation in membranes and, hence, cell dysfunction. Several lines of evidence suggest that A\u03b2 partitions in the cell membrane accumulate mostly in raft domains, the site where the cleavage of the precursor A\u03b2PP by \u03b2- and \u03b3- secretase is also thought to occur. The main consequence of the pathogenesis of AD is the disruption of the cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and in the basal forebrain. In parallel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been extensively linked to membrane properties. Since its transmembrane domain exhibits extensive contacts with the surrounding lipids, the acetylcholine receptor function is conditioned by its lipid microenvironment. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is present in high-density clusters in the cell membrane where it localizes mainly in lipid-ordered domains. Perturbations of sphingomyelin or cholesterol composition alter acetylcholine receptor location. Therefore, A\u03b2 processing, A\u03b2 partitioning, and acetylcholine receptor location and function can be manipulated by changes in membrane lipid biophysics. Understanding these mechanisms should provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for prevention and/or treatment of AD.

Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (D3NB) is a synthetic compound originally isolated from the seeds of Apium graveolens, which exhibits neuroprotective effects against some neurological diseases. However, the protective mechanisms of D3NB in a CCH model mimicking vascular cognitive impairment remains to be explored. We induced CCH in rats by a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) operation. Animals were randomly divided into a sham-operated group, CCH 4-week group, CCH 8-week group, and the corresponding D3NB-treatment groups. Cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to mimic CCH in vitro. We aimed to explore the effects of D3NB treatment on hippocampal neuronal death after CCH as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. We observed memory impairment and increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in the CCH groups, combined with inhibition of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, as compared with that of sham control rats. D3NB significantly attenuated cognitive impairment in CCH rats and decreased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis after BCCAO in vivo or OGD/R in vitro. More importantly, D3NB reversed the inhibition of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1 expression and activated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 counteracted the protective effects of D3NB in vitro. Our results suggest that D3NB could improve cognitive function after CCH and that this neuroprotective effect may be associated with reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis via modulation of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. D3NB may be a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular cognitive impairment induced by CCH.", "title": "Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide Alleviates Hippocampal Neuron Damage in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion via Regulation of the CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1/JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathways"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "005cc2d48c7f46008e68b8d6c5565057", "created_date": "2021-01-13T04:23:25Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:56:38Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2314-6745", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2314-6753", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1155/2016/4270301", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2016", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdr/guidelines/"}], "issns": ["2314-6745", "2314-6753"], "publisher": "Hindawi Limited", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Journal of Diabetes Research"}, "year": "2016", "subject": [{"code": "RC648-665", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Diseases of the endocrine glands.

In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18\u201329), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors.

Previous studies described that GO promotes the differentiation of neural stem cells and may be useful for neural regeneration. In this study, we examined the capacity of GO, full reduced (FRGO), and partially reduced (PRGO) powder and film to support survival, proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and bioenergetic function of a dopaminergic (DA) cell line derived from the mouse substantia nigra (SN4741). Our results show that the morphology of the film and the species of graphene (GO, PRGO, or FRGO) influences the behavior and function of these neurons. In general, we found better biocompatibility of the film species than that of the powder. Analysis of cell viability and cytotoxicity showed good cell survival, a lack of cell death in all GO forms and its derivatives, a decreased proliferation, and increased differentiation over time. Neuronal maturation of SN4741 in all GO forms, and its derivatives were assessed by increased protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), the glutamate inward rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2), and of synaptic proteins, such as synaptobrevin and synaptophysin. Notably, PRGO-film increased the levels of Tuj1 and the expression of transcription factors specific for midbrain DA neurons, such as Pitx3, Lmx1a, and Lmx1b. Bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption modified by distinct GO species and were different between powder and film for the same GO species. Our results indicate that PRGO-film was the best GO species at maintaining mitochondrial function compared to control. Finally, different GO forms, and particularly PRGO-film was also found to prevent the loss of DA cells and the decrease of the \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in a molecular environment where oxidative stress has been induced to model Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, PRGO-film is the most efficient graphene species at promoting DA differentiation and preventing DA cell loss, thus becoming a suitable scaffold to test new drugs or develop constructs for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapy.", "title": "Graphene Oxide and Reduced Derivatives, as Powder or Film Scaffolds, Differentially Promote Dopaminergic Neuron Differentiation and Survival"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "005ee457450e43ae897bc5aec664086e", "created_date": "2020-12-21T06:44:27Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:01:22Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5099", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnmol.2015.00045", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "8", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/molecular-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5099"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience"}, "month": "8", "keywords": ["peptidomics", "peptide processing", "Mass-spectrometry", "ProSAAS", "7B2", "WFS1"], "year": "2015", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

The WFS1 gene product wolframin is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mice lacking this gene exhibit disturbances in the processing and secretion of peptides, such as vasopressin and insulin. In the brain, high levels of the wolframin protein have been observed in the hippocampus, amygdala and limbic structures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Wfs1 knockout on peptide processing in mouse hippocampus. A peptidomic approach was used to characterize individual peptides in the hippocampus of wild-type and Wfs1 knockout mice. ResultsWe identified 126 peptides in hippocampal extracts and the levels of 10 peptides differed between Wfs1 KO and wild-type mice at P<0.05. The peptide with the largest alteration was little-LEN, which level was 25 times higher in the hippocampus of Wfs1 KO mice compared to wild-type mice. Processing (cleavage) of little-LEN from the Pcsk1n gene product proSAAS involves prohormone convertase 2 (PC2). Thus, PC2 activity was measured in extracts prepared from the hippocampus of Wfs1 knockout mice. The activity of PC2 in Wfs1 mutant mice was significantly higher (149.9\u00b12.3%, p<0.0001, n=8) than in wild-type mice (100.0\u00b17.0%, n=8). However, Western blot analysis showed that protein levels of 7B2, proPC2 and PC2 were same in both groups, and so were gene expression levels.ConclusionsProcessing of proSAAS is altered in the hippocampus of Wfs1-KO mice, which is caused by increased activity of PC2. Increased activity of PC2 in Wfs1 knockout mice is not caused by alteration in the levels of PC2 protein. Our results suggest a functional link between Wfs1 and PC2.

We tested two inbred mouse strains (BALB/c, C57BL/6J; male; 3-month-old) for glucocorticoid stress system markers (expression of MR and GR mRNA and protein in hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex; blood plasma corticosterone), used behavioral tasks for emotions and cognitive performance (elevated plus maze, holeboard) to assess the interdependence of these factors. We hypothesize that BALB/c mice have a stress-vulnerable neuroendocrine phenotype and that emotional expressions in BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice will differentially contribute to learning and memory. We applied factor analyses on emotional and cognitive parameters to determine the behavioral structure of BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice. Glucocorticoid stress system markers indeed show that BALB/c mice are more stress-vulnerable than C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, emotional and explorative factors differed between na&#239;ve BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice. BALB/c mice display high movement in anxiogenic zones and high risk assessment, while C57BL/6J mice show little movement in anxiogenic zones and display high vertical exploration. Furthermore, BALB/c mice are superior learners, showing learning related behavior which is highly structured and emotionally biased when exposed to a novel or changing situation. In contrast, C57BL/6J mice display a rather &#8216;&#8216;chaotic&#8217;&#8217; behavioral structure during learning in absence of an emotional factor.

Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemistry analysis of CNS sections using specific anti-bacterial antibodies identified prokaryotic cells in neural tissue. Finally, we assayed for the repeat expansion of the hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in C9orf72, which is considered the most common genetic cause of ALS in patients, using DNA extracted from ALS CNS tissue. We failed to find this repeated sequence in any of the eleven patients analyzed. Our results indicate that bacterial DNA and prokaryotic cells are present in CNS tissue, leading to the concept that both fungal and bacterial infections coexist in patients with ALS. These observations lay the groundwork for the use of appropriate therapies to eradicate the polymicrobial infections in ALS.", "title": "Searching for Bacteria in Neural Tissue From Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-02-26T05:50:00Z", "id": "005fcea11ff547d890ab289920003945"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:49:15Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1186/s40478-020-01010-8", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2051-5960", "type": "eissn"}], "end_page": "18", "keywords": ["Progressive multiple sclerosis", "Mass cytometry", "Microglia", "Myeloid cells", "Active lesion"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "RC346-429", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurology.

While such variability is attributed to inter-individual differences in increased intracranial pressure, tumor infiltration, and vascular compromise, a direct association with disease stage, tumor size and location, edema, and necrotic cell death has yet to be established. The lack of specificity of neurologic symptoms often confounds the diagnosis of GBM. It also limits clinicians\u2019 ability to elect treatment regimens that not only prolong survival but also promote symptom management and high quality of life.Methods: To decipher the heterogeneous presentation of neurologic symptoms in GBM, we investigated differences in the molecular makeup of tumors from patients with and without preoperative neurologic deficits. We used the Ivy GAP (Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project) database to integrate RNA sequencing data from histologically defined GBM tumor compartments and neurologic examination records for 41 patients. We investigated the association of neurologic deficits with various tumor and patient attributes. We then performed differential gene expression and co-expression network analysis to identify a transcriptional signature specific to neurologic deficits in GBM. Using functional enrichment analysis, we finally provided a comprehensive and detailed characterization of involved pathways and gene interactions.Results: An exploratory investigation of the association of tumor and patient variables with the early development of neurologic deficits in GBM revealed a lack of robust and consistent clinicopathologic prognostic factors. We detected significant differences in the expression of 728 genes (FDR-adjusted p-value \u2264 0.05 and relative fold-change \u2265 1.5), unique to the cellular tumor (CT) anatomical compartment, between neurologic deficit groups. Upregulated differentially expressed genes in CT were enriched for mesenchymal subtype-predictive genes. Applying a systems approach, we then identified co-expressed gene sets that correlated with neurological deficit manifestation (FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.1). Collectively, these findings uncovered significantly enriched immune activation, oxidative stress response, and cytokine-mediated proinflammatory processes.Conclusion: Our study posits that inflammatory processes, as well as a mesenchymal tumor subtype, are implicated in the pathophysiology of preoperative neurologic deficits in GBM.", "title": "An Inflammatory Landscape for Preoperative Neurologic Deficits in Glioblastoma"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-06-04T15:44:18Z", "id": "0063cbd1b90b48dd8d9136c77bfb1a08"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:43:25Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-2295", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fneur.2018.00001", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neurology#about"}], "issns": ["1664-2295"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neurology"}, "month": "01", "keywords": ["atomic force microscopy", "brain mechanics", "cortex stiffness", "neurodegenerative disease", "animal model"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC346-429", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurology.

Together with use of induced pluripotent stem cells or/and CRISPR-based recombineering the retinal organoid technology provided an avenue for developing models of human retinal degenerative diseases \u201cin a dish\u201d for studying the pathology, delineating the mechanisms and also establishing a platform for large-scale drug screening. At the same time, retinal organoids, highly resembling developing human fetal retinal tissue, are viewed as source of multipotential retinal progenitors, young photoreceptors and just the whole retinal tissue, which may be transplanted into the subretinal space with a goal of replacing patient\u2019s degenerated retina with a new retinal \u201cpatch.\u201d Both approaches (transplantation and modeling/drug screening) were projected when Yoshiki Sasai demonstrated the feasibility of deriving mammalian retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells, and generated a lot of excitement. With further work and testing of both approaches in vitro and in vivo, a major implicit limitation has become apparent pretty quickly: the absence of the uniform layer of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells, which is normally present in mammalian retina, surrounds photoreceptor layer and develops and matures first. The RPE layer polarize into apical and basal sides during development and establish microvilli on the apical side, interacting with photoreceptors, nurturing photoreceptor outer segments and participating in the visual cycle by recycling 11-trans retinal (bleached pigment) back to 11-cis retinal. Retinal organoids, however, either do not have RPE layer or carry patches of RPE mostly on one side, thus directly exposing most photoreceptors in the developing organoids to neural medium. Recreation of the critical retinal niche between the apical RPE and photoreceptors, where many retinal disease mechanisms originate, is so far unattainable, imposes clear limitations on both modeling/drug screening and transplantation approaches and is a focus of investigation in many labs. Here we dissect different retinal degenerative diseases and analyze how and where retinal organoid technology can contribute the most to developing therapies even with a current limitation and absence of long and functional outer segments, supported by RPE.", "title": "Limitations and Promise of Retinal Tissue From Human Pluripotent Stem Cells for Developing Therapies of Blindness"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00657e09d49e4cc1bfa9da60f863fd54", "created_date": "2020-09-10T16:01:30Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:48:08Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2314-6133", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "2314-6141", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1155/2015/487241", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2015", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/guidelines/"}], "issns": ["2314-6133", "2314-6141"], "publisher": "Hindawi Limited", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BioMed Research International"}, "year": "2015", "subject": [{"code": "R", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of State Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos 6627, 31270-901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil", "name": "Antonio Carlos Pinheiro de Oliveira"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA", "name": "Eduardo Candelario-Jalil"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Freiburg Medical School, Hauptstrasse  5, 79104 Freiburg, Germany", "name": "Bernd L.

Among these disorders, ischemic injury is a prominent cause of death and disability worldwide. Brain ischemia stems from cardiac arrest or stroke, both responsible for insufficient blood supply to the brain parenchyma. Glucose and oxygen deficiency disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, which results in energy depletion and ionic imbalance, followed by cell membrane depolarization, calcium (Ca2+) overload, and extracellular accumulation of excitatory amino acid glutamate. If tight physiological regulation fails to clear the surplus of this neurotransmitter, subsequent prolonged activation of glutamate receptors forms a vicious circle between elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ ions and aberrant glutamate release, aggravating the effect of this ischemic pathway. The activation of downstream Ca2+-dependent enzymes has a catastrophic impact on nervous tissue leading to cell death, accompanied by the formation of free radicals, edema, and inflammation. After decades of \u201cneuron-centric\u201d approaches, recent research has also finally shed some light on the role of glial cells in neurological diseases. It is becoming more and more evident that neurons and glia depend on each other. Neuronal cells, astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia, and oligodendrocytes all have their roles in what is known as glutamate excitotoxicity. However, who is the main contributor to the ischemic pathway, and who is the unsuspecting victim?

This observation might pave the way for novel closed-loop approaches comprising a cortical sensor. Enhanced beta oscillations (13-35 Hz) have been linked to the pathophysiology of PD and may serve as such a candidate marker to localize a cortical area reliably modulated by DBS. However, beta-oscillations are widely distributed over the cortical surface, necessitating an additional signal source for spotting the cortical area linked to the pathologically synchronized cortico-subcortical motor network.In this context, both cortico-subthalamic coherence and cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) have been studied in PD patients. Whereas the former requires invasive recordings, the latter allows for non-invasive detection, but displays a rather distributed cortical synchronization pattern in motor tasks. This distributed cortical representation may conflict with the goal of detecting a cortical localization with robust biomarker properties which is detectable on a single subject basis. We propose that this limitation could be overcome when recording CMC at rest. We hypothesized that \u2013 unlike healthy subjects \u2013 PD would show CMC at rest owing to the enhanced beta oscillations observed in PD. By performing source space analysis of beta CMC recorded during resting-state magnetoencephalography, we provide preliminary evidence in one patient for a cortical hot spot that is modulated most strongly by subthalamic DBS. Such a spot would provide a prominent target region either for direct neuromodulation or for placing a potential sensor in closed-loop DBS approaches, a proposal that requires investigation in a larger cohort of PD patients.", "title": "Detecting a cortical fingerprint of Parkinson\u2019s disease for closed-loop neuromodulation"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2016-07-01T11:16:20Z", "id": "00693910ec6648ab87d610984eac2b3e"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:35:51Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2213-1582", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102339", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "27", "number": "", "country": "NL", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "http://www.elsevier.com/journals/neuroimage-clinical/2213-1582/open-access-journal"}], "issns": ["2213-1582"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "NeuroImage: Clinical"}, "end_page": "", "keywords": ["Schizophrenia", "Neurofeedback", "Cognitive remediation", "Working memory", "N-back", "Gamma"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "102339", "subject": [{"code": "R858-859.7", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Computer applications to medicine.

Impairments in cognition occur early in the course of illness and are associated with poor functional outcome, but have been difficult to treat with conventional treatments. Recent studies have implicated abnormal neural network dynamics and impaired connectivity in frontal brain regions as possible causes of cognitive deficits. For example, high-frequency, dorsal-lateral prefrontal oscillatory activity in the gamma range (30\u201350\u00a0Hz) is associated with impaired working memory in individuals with schizophrenia.\u00a0In light of these findings, it may be possible to use EEG neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) to train individuals with schizophrenia to enhance frontal gamma activity to improve working memory and cognition. In a single-group, proof-of-concept study, 31 individuals with schizophrenia received 12\u00a0weeks of twice weekly EEG-NFB to enhance frontal gamma band response. EEG-NFB was well-tolerated, associated with increased gamma training threshold, and significant increases in frontal gamma power during an n-back working memory task. Additionally, EEG-NFB was associated with significant improvements in n-back performance and working memory, speed of processing, and reasoning and problem solving on neuropsychological tests. Change in gamma power was associated with change in cognition. Significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms were also found.

In this study, we briefly discuss various markers that have been proposed to predict cognitive performance. Next, we develop a novel approach to characterize cognitive performance by analyzing eye-blink rate variability dynamics. Our findings are based on a sample of 24 subjects. The subjects were given a 5-min resting period prior to a 10-min IQ test. During both stages, eye blinks were recorded from Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes. We found that scale exponents estimated for blink rate variability during rest were correlated with subjects' performance on the subsequent IQ test. This surprising phenomenon could be explained by the person to person variation in concentrations of dopamine in PFC and accumulation of GABA in the visual cortex, as both neurotransmitters play a key role in cognitive processes and affect blinking.

In fact, astrocyte activation causes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may lead to secondary injury.

Traditional models of neglect have focused on impaired spatial attention as the core deficit and as such, most rehabilitation methods have tried to improve attentional processes. However, many of these techniques (e.g., visual scanning training, caloric stimulation, neck muscle vibration) produce only short-lived effects, or are too uncomfortable to use as a routine treatment. More recently, many investigators have begun examining the beneficial effects of prism adaptation for the treatment of neglect. Although prism adaptation has been shown to have some beneficial effects on both overt and covert spatial attention, it does not reliably alter many of the perceptual biases evident in neglect. One of the challenges of neglect rehabilitation may lie in the heterogeneous nature of the deficits. Most notably, a number of researchers have shown that neglect patients present with severe deficits in spatial working memory (SWM) in addition to their attentional impairment. Given that SWM can be seen as a foundational cognitive mechanism, critical for a wide range of other functions, any deficit in SWM memory will undoubtedly have severe consequences. In the current review we examine the evidence for SWM deficits in neglect and propose that it constitutes a core component of the syndrome. We present preliminary data which suggest that at least one current rehabilitation method (prism adaptation) has no effect on SWM deficits in neglect. Finally, we end by reviewing recent work that examines the effectiveness of SWM training and how SWM training may prove to be a useful avenue for future rehabilitative efforts in patients with neglect.", "title": "Spatial working memory deficits represent a core challenge for rehabilitating neglect."}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2014-05-22T09:40:40Z", "id": "0076325cbf274fd89266856b3a3297b4"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:34:01Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-453X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnins.2019.00625", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "13", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-453X", "1662-4548"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neuroscience"}, "month": "7", "keywords": ["convolutional spiking neural networks", "time-to-first-spike coding", "one spike per neuron", "STDP", "reward-modulated STDP", "tensor-based computing"], "year": "2019", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Additionally, it compared the effect of location and number of points of contact to the control of posture in young adults. The location consisted of using the anchors tied to the finger and held by the hands, and, for LT, the fingertip. For the number of points of contact, participants used two hands, and then separately the dominant hand, and the non-dominant hand, for both anchor and LT paradigms. Participants stood upright with feet-together and in tandem position while performing tasks that combined the use of anchors and LT, points of contact (hand grip and finger), and number of points of contact (two hands and one hand). In this study, the anchors consist of holding in each hand a flexible cable with the other end attached to the ground. The LT consists of slightly touching a rigid surface with the tip of the index finger. The results showed, first, that the anchors improved postural control less than did the LT. Second, they revealed that holding the anchors with the hands or with them tied to the fingertip resulted in a similar reduction in postural sway only in the tandem position. For the feet-together position, the anchors tied to the fingertip were ineffective. Similarly, the use of one or two hands did not affect the contribution of the anchors.

Early life antibiotic use is one factor which may contribute to immune dysfunction and the recent surge in allergies by virtue of its effects on gut microbiota. Objective and methods As a first step towards determining whether a relationship exists between perinatal antibiotic induced changes in the gut microbiota and the later development of a peanut allergy, we exposed newborn mice to either the broad-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin or to a vehicle for 6\u00a0weeks and then used a novel murine model of peanut allergy. Results Early-life treatment with vancomycin resulted in a significant shift in the gut microbiota community characterized by a reduction in the abundance of firmicutes and preponderance of inflammatory proteobacteria. Mice with an antibiotic-altered microbiota, showed a localized allergic-like response characterized by ear swelling and scratching following intra-dermal peanut antigen challenge. Likewise, circulating IgE levels were increased in antibiotic-treated mice, but no evidence of a systemic allergic or anaphylactic-like response was observed. Importantly, we utilized the naturally occurring pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), rather than the more commonly used cholera toxin, as an adjuvant together with the peanut antigen. Conclusion Our data suggest that early antibiotic exposure promotes a shift in the gut microbiota community that may in turn, influence how mice later respond to a TNF-\u03b1\u2009+\u2009antigen challenge. However, further studies verifying the capacity of microbiota restoration to protect against allergic responses will be needed to confirm a causal role of antibiotic-induced microbiota variations in promoting allergic disease phenotypes.", "title": "Perinatal antibiotic exposure alters composition of murine gut microbiota and may influence later responses to peanut antigen", "journal": {"volume": "14", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/about"}], "issns": ["1710-1484", "1710-1492"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology"}, "month": "11", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-11-04T12:32:03Z", "id": "007912737fd04ac7a522bff5e2c7e69c"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:20:00Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-453X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnins.2020.00617", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "14", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-453X", "1662-4548"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neuroscience"}, "month": "6", "keywords": ["cardiorespiratory coupling", "Network Physiology", "partial directed coherence", "transfer entropy", "schizophrenia", "relatives"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

To answer this, we derive a bound for a general measure of variability -- spike-train entropy. This leads to important insights on the variability of multi-cell spike pattern distributions in large recurrent networks of spiking neurons responding to fluctuating inputs. The analysis is based on results from random dynamical systems theory and is complemented by detailed numerical simulations. We find that the spike pattern entropy is an order of magnitude lower than what would be extrapolated from single cells.  This holds despite the fact that network coupling becomes vanishingly sparse as network size grows -- a phenomenon that depends on ``extensive chaos, as previously discovered for balanced networks without stimulus drive.

The bilateral caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), and globus pallidus (Gp) were selected as the regions of interest (ROIs). Susceptibility values of bilateral ROIs were calculated and compared between the affected side and unaffected side in patients with MCAO and between patients with MCAO and healthy controls. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the diagnostic capability of susceptibility values in differentiating healthy controls and patients with MCAO by the area under the curve (AUC).Results: The susceptibility values of bilateral Cd were asymmetric in healthy controls; however, this asymmetry disappeared in patients with MCAO. In addition, compared with healthy controls, the average susceptibility values of the bilateral Pt in patients with MCAO were increased (P &lt; 0.05), and the average susceptibility value of the bilateral Gp was decreased (P &lt; 0.05). ROC curves showed that the susceptibility values of the Pt and Gp had a larger AUC (AUC = 0.700 and 0.889, respectively).Conclusion: As measured by QSM, the iron levels of the bilateral basal ganglia region were significantly changed in patients with MCAO.

We provide an analytic model to analyze network bursts generated by coupled adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that, for strong synaptic coupling, intrinsically tonic spiking neurons evolve to reach a synchronized intermittent bursting state. The presence of inhibitory neurons or plastic synapses can then modulate this dynamics in many ways but is not necessary for its appearance.

Methods: In situ hybridization for <i>Homer1a</i> was performed on rat tissue sections from cortical and striatal regions of interest (ROI) after acute or chronic administration of three antipsychotics with divergent receptor profile: Haloperidol, asenapine, and olanzapine. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the effects of topography, treatment, dose, and duration of antipsychotic administration were performed.

In line with this notion, we aimed to assess the pathophysiology of sensory disturbances in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, focusing on the satellite glial cells (SGCs) at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) as a new potential target of the disease.Material and Methods: The presence of sensory disturbances was evaluated using von Frey, hot plate, and hot water tail immersion tests at 75 days old, which represented the motor-pre-symptomatic stage. Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates.Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs.Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.", "title": "Satellite Glial Cells of the Dorsal Root Ganglion: A New \u201cGuest/Physiopathological Target\u201d in ALS"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00871c42f6c64e93b0f10f25fbd536af", "created_date": "2020-11-09T04:29:11Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:56:46Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2296-2360", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fped.2018.00364", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "6", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/pediatrics#about"}], "issns": ["2296-2360"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Pediatrics"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["randomized trial", "preterm birth", "delayed cord clamping", "neonatal care at the bedside", "cord milking", "placental circulation intact"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RJ1-570", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Pediatrics"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Careggi University Hospital of Florence, Florence, Italy", "name": "Simone Pratesi"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Careggi University Hospital of Florence, Florence, Italy", "name": "Simona Montano"}, {"affiliation": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Mother and Infant Science, Fondazione IRCCS \u201cCa' Granda\u201d Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy", "name": "Stefano Ghirardello"}, {"affiliation": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Mother and Infant Science, Fondazione IRCCS \u201cCa' Granda\u201d Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy", "name": "Fabio Mosca"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, Clinical Trials Coordinating Center, Istituto Toscano Tumori, University of Florence, Florence, Italy", "name": "Luca Boni"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, Clinical Trials Coordinating Center, Istituto Toscano Tumori, University of Florence, Florence, Italy", "name": "Lorenzo Tofani"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health, Careggi University Hospital of Florence, Florence, Italy", "name": "Carlo Dani"}], "link": [{"content_type": "HTML", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fped.2018.00364/full"}], "abstract": "Background: Preterm newborns receiving briefly delayed cord clamping or cord milking at birth have better neonatal outcomes. However, the time frame in which both these procedures are performed (&lt; 60 s of life) is too short to explore the possible beneficial effects on early infant postnatal adaptation and outcomes of a prolonged transfusion strategy associated with neonatal respiration.Methods and Design: We have designed a randomized, multicenter, controlled two-phase study: phase 1 to assess the feasibility of carrying out the protocol in a large randomized trial, and phase 2 to assess the efficacy of bedside assistance with intact placental circulation for 3 min in comparison to cord milking to improve outcome in the neonatal period; we present here the feasibility and safety phase of the study. Outcomes included feasibility (recruitment rate of two patients per month, compliance with the trial interventions, completeness of data collection, &gt;90% of infants receiving echographic assessments in the first 24 h) and safety variables (5 min Apgar score, delivery room intubation rate, CRIB II score, admission temperature, maximum hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit in the first 24 h and maximum serum bilirubin value) in the two study groups. We also evaluated the same safety variables in infants delivered during the study period but not recruited.Results: A total of 40 infants were enrolled. In all cases the protocol was completed and all feasibility outcomes were reached. Infants assisted with an intact placental circulation have a higher 5 min Apgar score but their admission temperature was lower than milked infants. Delivery room intubation rate, CRIB II score and peak serum bilirubin value were comparable in both groups. Infants who were not subjected to a placental transfusion strategy (excluded patients) had a higher delivery room intubation rate with respect to both study groups.Conclusion: Delaying cord clamping until 3 min of life was challenging but feasible and appeared to be safe. However, admission temperature must be strictly monitored and a more efficacious warming system could be implemented to prevent hypothermia during the procedure.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials,gov NCT02671305 (date of registration: 26 JAN 2016). https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02671305", "title": "Placental Circulation Intact Trial (PCI-T)\u2014Resuscitation With the Placental Circulation Intact vs. Cord Milking for Very Preterm Infants: A Feasibility Study"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-11-27T05:08:24Z", "id": "008902a7f61347bfb6df01ec7162100a"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:01:57Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5161", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnhum.2010.00234", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "4", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/human-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5161"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience"}, "month": "1", "keywords": ["Attention", "emotion", "inhibition", "face expression", "inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)", "medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)"], "year": "2011", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Sometimes such control is executed through suppression of an unwanted response in order to avoid conflict. Conflict occurs when two simultaneously competing processes lead to different behavioral outcomes, as seen in tasks such as the anti-saccade, go/no-go and the Stroop task. We set out to examine whether different types of stimuli in a modified emotional Stroop task would cause similar interference effects as the original Stroop-colour/word, and whether the required suppression mechanism(s) would recruit similar regions of the medial PFC (mPFC). By using emotional words and emotional faces in this Stroop experiment, we examined the two well-learned automatic behaviours of word reading and recognition of face expressions. In our emotional Stroop paradigm, words were processed faster than face expressions with incongruent trials yielding longer reaction times (RT) and larger number of errors compared to the congruent trials. This novel Stroop effect activated the anterior and inferior regions of the mPFC, namely the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as well as the superior frontal gyrus. Our results suggest that prepotent behaviours such as reading and recognition of face expressions are stimulus-dependent and perhaps hierarchical, hence recruiting distinct regions of the mPFC.  Moreover, the faster processing of word reading compared to reporting face expressions is indicative of the formation of stronger stimulus-response (SR) associations of an over-learned behaviour compared to an instinctive one, which could alternatively be explained through the distinction between awareness and selective attention.", "title": "Word wins over Face: Emotional Stroop effect activates the frontal cortical network"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2014-05-22T09:31:15Z", "id": "0089d2d9ef1749aaaeab133153e8d580"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:29:35Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2215-0013", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1016/j.scog.2019.100169", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "20", "number": "", "country": "US", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "https://www.elsevier.com/journals/schizophrenia-research-cognition/2215-0013/open-access-journal"}], "issns": ["2215-0013"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Schizophrenia Research: Cognition"}, "month": "06", "end_page": "", "year": "2020", "start_page": "", "subject": [{"code": "RC346-429", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurology.

However, few studies have examined the psychometrics of multiple social cognition measures in an Asian population. This study aims to evaluate the psychometrics of measures indexing the four core social cognition domains. Methods: Schizophrenia outpatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0116) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a073) completed a battery of nine social cognitive measures, twice, four weeks apart. Psychometric properties were examined via test-retest reliability, internal consistency, utility as a repeated measure, time administration, and tolerability. Logistic regression was performed to identify psychometrically sound tasks that best discriminated case-control status. PCA was conducted to explore social cognition dimensional structure. Results: The Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task (BLERT), Penn Emotion Recognition Task (ER40), and The Awareness of Social Inference Test, branch III (TASIT-3) showed strongest psychometrics. The Ambiguous Intentions and Hostility Questionnaire, Hostility Bias subscale (AIHQ-HB) showed slightly weaker properties, requiring further evaluation. The Hinting task, Mini Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (MiniPONS), Relationships Across Domains (RAD), Internal Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ), and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) showed poorer psychometrics in our sample. PCA revealed a two-factor solution comprising social cognition skills and attributional style/bias. Conclusion: Here, we examined the psychometric properties of a comprehensive social cognition battery based on the SCOPE study in an Asian schizophrenia population. Continued evaluation and standardization of social cognitive measures are needed to refine our understanding of this construct in schizophrenia.

Methods In this retrospective study, the records of 18 pseudophakic patients affected by Fuchs endothelial dystrophy who underwent DMEK in one eye and UT-DSAEK in the fellow eye were reviewed. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal pachymetry, keratometry, corneal aberrations, photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity, and endothelial cell counts measured 12\u2009months after surgery in either eye were analyzed and compared. The results of a satisfaction questionnaire were also reviewed. Results Twelve months after surgery, BCVA was not significantly different in UT-DSAEK and DMEK eyes (0.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 and 0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 logMAR, respectively); at both 4- and 6\u2009mm optical zones total and posterior corneal higher order aberrations (HOAs), posterior astigmatism and total coma were significantly lower after DMEK; BCVA in both groups was significantly correlated mainly with anterior corneal aberrations; contrast sensitivity was higher after DMEK especially in mesopic conditions and at medium spatial frequencies; the endothelial cell density was similar, although slightly higher in the UT-DSAEK group (p\u2009=\u20090.10). The satisfaction questionnaire showed that although patients were highly satisfied from both procedures, more than half of them preferred DMEK and reported a more comfortable and quicker postoperative recovery.

In addition, AGAP1 is a candidate susceptibility gene for two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ); yet its localization and function in neurons have not been described. Here, we describe that AGAP1 localizes to axons, dendrites, dendritic spines, and synapses, colocalizing preferentially with markers of early and recycling endosomes. Functional studies reveal overexpression and down-regulation of AGAP1 affects both neuronal endosomal trafficking and dendritic spine morphology, supporting a role for AGAP1 in the recycling endosomal trafficking involved in their morphogenesis. Finally, we determined the sensitivity of AGAP1 expression to mutations in the DTNBP1 gene, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorder, and found that AGAP1 mRNA and protein levels are selectively reduced in the null allele of the mouse orthologue of DTNBP1.

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and we have previously shown that astrocytes in substantia nigra (SN) are enriched in AQP4 relative to cortical astrocytes, and that their complement of AQP4 is further increased following treatment with the parkinsonogenic toxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). Here, we investigated the effect of <i>Aqp4</i> deletion on microglial activation in mice subjected to unilateral intrastriatal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+, the toxic metabolite of MPTP). Our results show that MPP+ injections lead to a pronounced increase in the expression level of microglial activating genes in the ventral mesencephalon of wild type (WT) mice, but not <i>Aqp4<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice. We also show, in WT mice, that MPP+ injections cause an upregulation of nigral AQP4 and swelling of astrocytic endfeet.

After ischemia the early massive increase of extracellular glutamate is followed by activation of resident immune cells, that is, microglia, and production or activation of inflammation mediators. Proinflammatory cytokines, which upregulate cell adhesion molecules, exert an important role in promoting recruitment of leukocytes that in turn promote expansion of the inflammatory response in ischemic tissue. Protracted neuroinflammation is now recognized as the predominant mechanism of secondary brain injury progression. A2A receptors present on central cells and on blood cells account for important effects depending on the time-related evolution of the pathological condition. Evidence suggests that A2A receptor antagonists provide early protection via centrally mediated control of excessive excitotoxicity, while A2A receptor agonists provide protracted protection by controlling massive blood cell infiltration in the hours and days after ischemia.

All tumors were reviewed histologically and subjected to array-based methylation analysis followed by algorithm-based classification into distinct methylation classes (MCs). The single MC containing the largest proportion of 25 tumors diagnosed as cGBM was MC anaplastic astrocytoma with piloid features representing a recently-described molecular tumor entity not yet included in the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (WHO classification). Twenty-nine tumors molecularly corresponded to either of 6 methylation subclasses subsumed in the MC family GBM IDH wildtype. Further we identified 6 tumors belonging to the MC diffuse midline glioma H3 K27\u2009M mutant and 6 tumors allotted to the MC IDH mutant glioma subclass astrocytoma. Two tumors were classified as MC pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa, one as MC CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration and one as MC control tissue, inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The methylation profiles of 16 tumors could not clearly be assigned to one distinct MC. In comparison to supratentorial localization, the MC GBM IDH wildtype subclass midline was overrepresented, whereas the MCs GBM IDH wildtype subclass mesenchymal and subclass RTK II were underrepresented in the cerebellum. Based on the integration of molecular and histological findings all tumors received an integrated diagnosis in line with the WHO classification 2016. In conclusion, cGBM does not represent a molecularly uniform tumor entity, but rather comprises different brain tumor entities with diverse prognosis and therapeutic options. Distinction of these molecular tumor classes requires molecular analysis. More than 30% of tumors diagnosed as cGBM belong to the recently described molecular entity of anaplastic astrocytoma with piloid features.", "title": "Tumors diagnosed as cerebellar glioblastoma comprise distinct molecular entities", "journal": {"volume": "7", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["2051-5960"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Acta Neuropathologica Communications"}, "month": "10", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "0096ccdbff054756ae8dadcbafbf2ff9", "created_date": "2019-10-29T16:18:20Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T01:42:57Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2076-3425", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3390/brainsci7080094", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "7", "number": "8", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci/about"}], "issns": ["2076-3425"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Brain Sciences"}, "month": "7", "keywords": ["social neuroscience", "applications", "health", "law", "neuroeconomics", "reverse inference", "reward", "social exclusion", "morality"], "year": "2017", "start_page": "94", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

During COVID-19 pathology, the central nervous system (CNS) is possibly affected by direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion, exaggerated systemic inflammatory responses, or hypoxia. Psychosocial stress imposed by the pandemic further affects the CNS of COVID-19 patients, but also the non-infected population, potentially contributing to the emergence or exacerbation of various neurological or mental health disorders. Microglia are central players of the CNS homeostasis maintenance and inflammatory response that exert their crucial functions in coordination with other CNS cells. During homeostatic challenges to the brain parenchyma, microglia modify their density, morphology, and molecular signature, resulting in the adjustment of their functions. In this review, we discuss how microglia may be involved in the neuroprotective and neurotoxic responses against CNS insults deriving from COVID-19. We examine how these responses may explain, at least partially, the neurological and psychiatric manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and the general population.

This focus is central to the use of communication skills related to empathy and even more crucial to provide information in a way that makes patients feel more involved in the treatment process. Psychoanalysis (PA) provides its initial concept of empathy based on affective aspects including findings from neuroscience and brain research. Enhancing cooperation between ME and PA can help to integrate both aspects of empathy into a longitudinal training program. Discussion The condition of psychoanalytic empathy definitions is the understanding of unconscious processes. It is important to primarily attend especially the dominant \ufeffaffects towards the patient before interpreting his or her behaviour, since in explaining the emerging affects, the analyst has to empathize with the patient to understand the (unconscious) reasons for its behaviour. A strong consideration of nonverbal communication, clinical perceptions, intuitive interaction, contagion-like processes and their implementation and empowerment in medical and therapeutic curricula is one way of beneficially using interdisciplinary approaches to yield empathy in clinical interaction. Conclusion Established methods of PA, like training of containment, reflective functioning, affective holding and giving meaningful interpretations in accordance with countertransferential and transferential aspects may help to put a focus on the clinican-patient-interaction and the preservation of the physicians\u2019 (mental) health. In consequence of the discussion of various training methods that take the theoretical and practical concepts\u00a0of empathy into account, we aim for an implementation of the named methods in the medical curricula.", "title": "Empathy in Psychoanalysis and Medical Education - what can we learn from each other?", "journal": {"volume": "17", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/copyright"}], "issns": ["1472-6920"], "publisher": "BMC", "language": ["EN"], "title": "BMC Medical Education"}, "month": "5", "start_page": "1"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-08-14T11:50:05Z", "id": "009be56d597d4033ac0ef37f6ec35197"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T00:19:09Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1664-0640", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00043", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/psychiatry#about"}], "issns": ["1664-0640"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Psychiatry"}, "month": "2", "keywords": ["Intolerance-to-Delay Task", "sucrose consumption", "appetitive food eating", "reward sensitivity", "behavioral rigidity"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC435-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Psychiatry"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy", "name": "Stefano Cinque"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy", "name": "Stefano Cinque"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy", "name": "Francesca Zoratto"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy", "name": "Anna Poleggi"}, {"affiliation": "Neuroscience and Brain Technologies Department, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy", "name": "Damiana Leo"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Psychology, International Telematic University Uninettuno, Rome, Italy", "name": "Luca Cerniglia"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy", "name": "Silvia Cimino"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy", "name": "Renata Tambelli"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy", "name": "Enrico Alleva"}, {"affiliation": "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia", "name": "Raul R.

Such diseases typically feature poor decision making and lack of control on executive functions and have been studied through the years using many animal models. Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) mice, in particular, have been widely used to study ADHD. Recently, a strain of DAT KO rats has been developed (1). Here, we provide a phenotypic characterization of reward sensitivity and compulsive choice by adult rats born from DAT\u2013HET dams bred with DAT\u2013HET males, in order to further validate DAT KO rats as an animal model for preclinical research. We first tested DAT KO rats\u2019 sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, provided by highly appetitive food or sweet water; then, we tested their choice behavior with an Intolerance-to-Delay Task (IDT). During these tests, DAT KO rats appeared less sensitive to rewarding stimuli than wild-type (WT) and HET rats: they also showed a prominent hyperactive behavior with a rigid choice pattern and a wide number of compulsive stereotypies. Moreover, during the IDT, we tested the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and RO-5203648, a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial agonist. AMPH accentuated impulsive behaviors in WT and HET rats, while it had no effect in DAT KO rats. Finally, we measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine receptor 2 (D2), serotonin transporter, and TAAR1 mRNA transcripts in samples of ventral striatum, finding no significant differences between WT and KO genotypes.

In this study we sought to examine how the ability to perceive own emotions assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale related to both the ability to perceive emotions depicted in point-light displays and the confidence in these perceptions. Participants observed video scenes of human interactions, rated the depicted valence, and judged their confidence in this rating. Results showed that people with higher alexithymia scores were significantly less confident about their decisions, but did not differ from people with lower alexithymia scores in the valence of their ratings.

We did a global synthesis of the evidence regarding the health of this population. We searched Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, PubMed, Web of Science, CINCH, Global Health, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Campbell Library, the National Criminal Justice Reference System Abstract Database, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed journal articles, including reviews, that reported the prevalence of at least one health outcome (physical, mental, sexual, infectious, and neurocognitive) in adolescents (aged <20 years) in detention, and were published between Jan 1, 1980, and June 30, 2018. The reference lists of published review articles were scrutinised for additional relevant publications. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and three reviewed full texts of relevant articles. The protocol for this Review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016041392). 245 articles (204 primary research articles and 41 reviews) were included, with most primary research (183 [90%]) done in high-income countries. A high lifetime prevalence of health problems, risks, and conditions was reported in detained adolescents, including mental disorders (0\u201395%), substance use disorders (22\u201396%), self-harm (12\u201365%), neurodevelopmental disabilities (2\u201347%), infectious diseases (0\u201334%), and sexual and reproductive conditions (pregnant by age 19 years 20\u201337%; abnormal cervical screening test result 16%). Various physical and mental health problems and health-risk behaviours are more common among adolescents in detention than among their peers who have not been detained. As the social and structural drivers of poor health overlap somewhat with factors associated with exposure to the criminal justice system, strategies to address these factors could help to reduce both rates of adolescent detention and adolescent health inequalities. Improving the detection of mental and physical disorders, providing appropriate interventions during detention, and optimising transitional health care after release from detention could improve the health outcomes of these vulnerable young people.", "title": "The health of adolescents in detention: a global scoping review"}, "id": "00a449ace50d4f6c8fc1733b0a8f56b5", "created_date": "2020-02-07T04:23:59Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T04:02:17Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1663-3563", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnsyn.2020.551691", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/synaptic-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1663-3563"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["olfactory bulb", "granule cell", "two-photon (2P) uncaging", "two-photon sodium imaging", "two-photon calcium imaging", "asynchronous release"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Locally triggered release of GABA from the large reciprocal GC spines occurs on both fast and slow time scales, possibly enabling parallel processing during olfactory perception. Here we investigate local mechanisms for asynchronous spine output. To reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of postsynaptic ion transients, we imaged spine and adjacent dendrite Ca2 +- and Na+-signals with minimal exogenous buffering by the respective fluorescent indicator dyes upon two-photon uncaging of DNI-glutamate in OB slices from juvenile rats. Both postsynaptic fluorescence signals decayed slowly, with average half durations in the spine head of t1/2_\u0394[Ca2 +]i \u223c500 ms and t1/2_\u0394[Na+]i \u223c1,000 ms. We also analyzed the kinetics of already existing data of postsynaptic spine Ca2 +-signals in response to glomerular stimulation in OB slices from adult mice, either WT or animals with partial GC glutamate receptor deletions (NMDAR: GluN1 subunit; AMPAR: GluA2 subunit). In a large subset of spines the fluorescence signal had a protracted rise time (average time to peak \u223c400 ms, range 20 to &gt;1,000 ms). This slow rise was independent of Ca2 + entry via NMDARs, since similarly slow signals occurred in \u0394GluN1 GCs. Additional Ca2 + entry in \u0394GluA2 GCs (with AMPARs rendered Ca2 +-permeable), however, resulted in larger \u0394F/Fs that rose yet more slowly. Thus GC spines appear to dispose of several local mechanisms to promote asynchronous GABA release, which are reflected in the time course of mitral/tufted cell recurrent inhibition.", "title": "Local Postsynaptic Signaling on Slow Time Scales in Reciprocal Olfactory Bulb Granule Cell Spines Matches Asynchronous Release"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00a4838323e64e4a82ce5fc6de28798f", "created_date": "2020-11-16T06:23:52Z"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:09:43Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-453X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnins.2018.00209", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-453X", "1662-4548"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neuroscience"}, "month": "4", "keywords": ["gene-based", "family-based", "clustering", "variance-component", "transmission disequilibrium", "rare variants"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Among environmental challenges, homeostatic responses to temperature extremes are critical to animal survival under natural conditions. We previously reported that axon terminal arborization in Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions is enhanced at elevated temperatures; however, the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) remains unaltered despite the increase in synaptic bouton numbers. Here we determine the cellular basis of this homeostatic adjustment in larvae reared at high temperature (HT, 29 \u02daC). We found that synaptic current focally recorded from individual synaptic boutons was unaffected by rearing temperature (<15 \u02daC to >30 \u02daC). However, HT rearing decreased the quantal size (amplitude of spontaneous miniature EJPs, or mEJPs), which compensates for the increased number of synaptic releasing sites to retain a normal EJP size. The quantal size decrease is accounted for by a decrease in input resistance of the postsynaptic muscle fiber, indicating an increase in membrane area that matches the synaptic growth at HT. Interestingly, a mutation in rutabaga (rut) encoding adenylyl cyclase (AC) exhibited no obvious changes in quantal size or input resistance of postsynaptic muscle cells after HT rearing, suggesting an important role for rut AC in temperature-induced synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila. This extends our previous finding of rut-dependent synaptic homeostasis in hyperexcitable mutants, e.g. slowpoke (slo). In slo larvae, the lack of BK channel function is partially ameliorated by upregulation of presynaptic Sh IA current to limit excessive transmitter release in addition to postsynaptic glutamate receptor recomposition that reduces the quantal size.", "title": "The role of cAMP in synaptic homeostasis in response to environmental temperature challenges and hyperexcitability mutations"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2015-09-11T15:12:53Z", "id": "00a53c665a044bd29250d636ebfc45b0"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T03:42:25Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5099", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnmol.2020.00155", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "13", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/molecular-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5099"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience"}, "month": "8", "keywords": ["tau", "oligomer", "neuron", "electrophysiology", "tauopathy"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

In humans, pathological forms of tau are implicated in a range of diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for maintaining the correct balance of tau phosphorylation to enable axons to be both stable and labile enough to function properly. In the early stages of tauopathies, this balance is interrupted leading to dissociation of tau from microtubules. This leaves microtubules prone to damage and phosphorylated tau prone to aggregation. Initially, phosphorylated tau forms oligomers, then fibrils, and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It is widely accepted that the initial soluble oligomeric forms of tau are probably the most pathologically relevant species but there is relatively little quantitative information to explain exactly what their toxic effects are at the individual neuron level. Electrophysiology provides a valuable tool to help uncover the mechanisms of action of tau oligomers on synaptic transmission within single neurons. Understanding the concentration-, time-, and neuronal compartment-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers on neuronal and synaptic properties are essential to understanding how best to counteract its effects and to develop effective treatment strategies.

Quantifying redundancy requires assigning an identity to different information pieces, to assess when information is common across sources. Harder et al. (2013) proposed an identity axiom that imposes necessary conditions to quantify qualitatively common information. However, Bertschinger et al.

Here, we study systematically the consequences of information identity criteria that assign identity based on associations between target and source variables resulting from deterministic dependencies. We show how these criteria are related to the identity axiom and to previously proposed redundancy measures, and we characterize how they lead to negative PID terms. This constitutes a further step to more explicitly address the role of information identity in the quantification of redundancy.

One potential contributor is racial bias in pain perception &ndash; including low-level implicit biases and explicitly held lay-beliefs. Delays in seeking pain treatment may compound these disparities. However, experiments testing these factors in the context of Latinx-American pain are limited, and mechanisms by which Latinx-American group-membership influences pain perception and treatment are not understood.Methods: Here, Latinx-American and White-American participants read vignettes including a Latinx or White patient&rsquo;s pain description and numerical pain rating. Participants then rated how much pain they thought each patient was in using the same numerical scale. Participants also reported how much pain they themselves would need to experience to prompt treatment-seeking.Results: In contrast to prior work identifying lay beliefs that Latinx-Americans feel less pain than White-Americans, participants in the current study revealed a bias in the opposite direction. This was largely driven, however, by Latinx-American participants, who have been under-represented in previous studies of empathy and pain perception. Latinx-Americans ascribed more pain to patients overall &ndash; irrespective of patient race &ndash; relative to White-Americans. Latinx-American participants also reported that their own pain would need to be significantly more intense before seeing a doctor.Conclusion: These results suggest that, relative to White-Americans, Latinx-Americans may be more likely to believe people are in more pain than they report &ndash; or may be more perceptive of others&rsquo; pain &ndash; and that they may be in more pain upon presenting to medical settings.Keywords: disparities, race, ethnicity, empathy", "title": "The influence of Latinx American identity on pain perception and treatment seeking", "journal": {"volume": "Volume 12", "country": "GB", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC", "type": "CC BY-NC", "url": "http://www.dovepress.com/why_publish_with_dove.php?content_id=3045"}], "issns": ["1178-7090"], "publisher": "Dove Medical Press", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Journal of Pain Research"}, "month": "11", "start_page": "3025"}, "created_date": "2019-11-11T01:51:55Z", "id": "00a72019b2e740c8a22f9b868d11e350"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T23:29:22Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2471-2531", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1097/PR9.0000000000000577", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "1", "number": "4", "country": "US", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY-NC-ND", "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "url": "http://edmgr.ovid.com/painreports/accounts/ifauth.htm"}], "issns": ["2471-2531"], "publisher": "Wolters Kluwer", "language": ["EN"], "title": "PAIN Reports"}, "month": "10", "year": "2016", "start_page": "e577", "subject": [{"code": "RD78.3-87.3", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Anesthesiology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto; Division of Brain, Imaging and Behaviour-Systems Neuroscience, Krembil Research Institute, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "name": "Karen D.

This article focuses on the role the nucleolus has as a hub in macromolecule regulation in the mammalian nucleus. The nucleolus has a well-established role in ribosome biogenesis and functions in several types of cellular stress responses. In addition to known reactions to DNA damaging and transcription inhibiting stresses, there is an emerging role of the nucleolus especially in responses to proteotoxic stress such as heat shock and inhibition of proteasome function. The nucleolus serves as an active regulatory site for detention of extranucleolar proteins. This takes place in nucleolar cavities and manifests in protein and RNA collections referred to as intranucleolar bodies (INBs), nucleolar aggresomes or amyloid bodies (A-bodies), depending on stress type, severity of accumulation, and material propensities of the macromolecular collections. These indicate a relevance of nucleolar function and regulation in neurodegeneration-related cellular events, but also provide surprising connections with cancer-related pathways. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing these processes remain largely undefined. In this article, the nucleolus as the site of protein and RNA accumulation and as a possible protective organelle for nuclear proteins during stress is viewed. In addition, recent evidence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and liquid-solid phase transition in the formation of nucleoli and its stress responses, respectively, are discussed, along with the increasingly indicated role and open questions for noncoding RNA species in these events.", "title": "Phase-to-Phase With Nucleoli \u2013 Stress Responses, Protein Aggregation and Novel Roles of RNA"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-04-26T05:40:11Z", "id": "00a7881810844e8bb2671a1856b0031f"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-24T22:47:23Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5110", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fncir.2013.00167", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "7", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neural-circuits#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5110"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["synchronization", "optogenetics", "bursting", "multielectrode arrays", "Network-level plasticity"], "year": "2013", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

We combined electrical recording using multi-electrode array with optical stimulation of cultured channelrhodopsin-2 transducted hippocampal neurons to study and manipulate network burst synchronization. We found low frequency photo-stimulation protocols that are sufficient to induce potentiation of network bursting, modifying bursting dynamics and increasing interneuronal synchronization.

It is distinguished from other demyelinating conditions by the presence of AQP4-IgG and serum aquaporin 4 (AQP4), found mainly in the blood\u2013brain barrier. This descriptive study was conducted from January 2015 to June 2018 at the National Center for Neurological Sciences (NCNS) in Khartoum, Sudan. All participants were Sudanese patients diagnosed with NMO. In our study the selection of cases was based on Dean Wingerchuk diagnostic criteria (2006), which states that the diagnosis of NMO should meet two absolute criteria and two supportive criteria. The absolute criteria are myelitis and optic neuritis, whereas supportive criteria include radiological findings obtained from brain and spinal cord MRI. Furthermore, AQP4-IgG levels were measured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum using immunofluorescence. Data were collected by a pre-designed questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 17. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 31 patients were enrolled in this study [6 male (19.4%) and 25 female (80.6%)]. The mean age was 38\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u00a0years. Motor and visual difficulties were the initial symptoms and occurred in 21 (67.7%) and 10 (32.3%) patients, respectively. Fundoscopy confirmed optic atrophy in 22 (71.0%) patients. The course of the disease revealed one relapse in 21 patients (67.7%). Seropositive AQP4-IgG were seen in 23 patients (79.31%). There was a significant correlation between AQP4 and response to treatment (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.038). The correlation between serum AQP4-IgG, showed that, complete improvement was detected in 2 patients (6.9%) one of them was positive and the other was negative, 20 (69.0%) patients presented with some disability, among them 18 (62.1%) were positive and 2 (6.9%) were negative, while 7 patients showed no improvement (24.1%) 4 out of them were positive (13.8%) and 3 were negative (10.3%). Conclusion At the initial presentation of NMO, longitudinal myelitis was observed more frequently than optic neuritis. More than two third of the patients showed strong seropositivity for serum AQP4.

Here we induced developmental cortical malformations in offspring, after intraventricular injection of methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in utero in mice. We combined extensive histological and electrophysiological studies to characterize the model. We found that MAM injections at E14 and E15 induced a range of cortical and hippocampal malformations resembling histological alterations of specific genetic mutations and transplacental mitotoxic agent injections. However, in contrast to most of these models, intraventricularly MAM-injected mice remained asymptomatic and showed no clear epilepsy-related phenotype as tested in long-term chronic recordings and with pharmacological manipulations. Instead, they exhibited a non-specific reduction of hippocampal-related brain oscillations (mostly in CA1); including theta, gamma and HFOs; and enhanced thalamocortical spindle activity during non-REM sleep. These data suggest that developmental cortical malformations do not necessarily correlate with epileptiform activity.

Consistent with the literature, old rats showed greater discounting of reward value when the probability of obtaining rewards dropped below 100%. Behaviorally, reward magnitude discrimination was the same between young and old rats, and yet these same rats exhibited reduced sensitivity to positive, but not negative, choice outcomes. The latter behavioral result was congruent with additional findings that the aged ventral tegmental neurons (including dopamine cells) were less responsive to rewards when compared to the same cell types recorded from young animals.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare cortical network changes after 6 weeks of visually cued handwriting training (= experimental) with a placebo intervention to address micrographia, a common problem in PD. Twenty seven early Parkinson's patients on dopaminergic medication performed a pre-writing task in both the presence and absence of visual cues during behavioral tests and during fMRI. Subsequently, patients were randomized to the experimental (N = 13) or placebo intervention (N = 14) both lasting 6 weeks, after which they underwent the same testing procedure. We used dynamic causal modeling to compare the neural network dynamics in both groups before and after training. Most importantly, intensive writing training propagated connectivity via the left hemispheric visuomotor stream to an increased coupling with the supplementary motor area, not witnessed in the placebo group. Training enhanced communication in the left visuomotor integration system in line with the learned visually steered training. Notably, this pattern was apparent irrespective of the presence of cues, suggesting transfer from cued to uncued handwriting. We conclude that in early PD intensive motor skill learning, which led to clinical improvement, alters cortical network functioning.

In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states.

However, in aged populations, the target cells in ORNs by cigarette smoke, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which cigarette smoke impairs the regenerative ORNs, and the degree of ORN regeneration after smoking cessation remain unclear.Objectives: To explore the effects of cigarette smoke on the ORN cell system using an aged mouse model of smoking, and to investigate the extent to which smoke-induced damage to ORNs recovers following cessation of exposure to cigarette smoke in aged mice.Methods: We intranasally administered a cigarette smoke solution (CSS) to 16-month-old male mice over 24 days, then examined ORN existence, cell survival, changes of inflammatory cytokines in the olfactory epithelium (OE), and olfaction using histological analyses, gene analyses and olfactory habituation/dishabituation tests.Results: CSS administration reduced the number of mature ORNs in the OE and induced olfactory dysfunction. These changes coincided with an increase in the number of apoptotic cells and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression and a decrease in Il6 expression. Notably, the reduction in mature ORNs did not recover even on day 28 after cessation of treatment with CSS, resulting in persistent olfactory dysfunction.Conclusion: In aged mice, by increasing ORN death, CSS exposure could eventually overwhelm the regenerative capacity of the OE, resulting in continued reduction in the number of mature ORNs and olfactory dysfunction.", "title": "Cigarette Smoke-Induced Cell Death Causes Persistent Olfactory Dysfunction in Aged Mice"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-06-13T05:16:26Z", "id": "00b2454a3dbc430191f8b3de8206bfcf"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T02:55:58Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1662-5161", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fnhum.2018.00413", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "12", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/human-neuroscience#about"}], "issns": ["1662-5161"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience"}, "month": "10", "keywords": ["cornu ammonis", "hippocampus", "amnestic mild cognitive impairment", "functional connectivity", "longitudinal study"], "year": "2018", "subject": [{"code": "RC321-571", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Neurosciences.

Previous studies have revealed subtle structural deficits of the CA subregions (CA1-CA3, bilateral) in aMCI; however, it is not clear how the network function is impacted by aMCI. The present study examined longitudinal changes in resting state functional connectivity (FC) of each CA subregion and how these changes relate to neuropsychological profiles in aMCI.Methods: Twenty aMCI and 20 healthy control (HC) participants underwent longitudinal cognitive assessment and resting state functional MRI scans at baseline and 15 months afterward. Imaging data were processed with published routines in SPM8 and CONN software. Two-way analysis of covariance was performed with covariates of age, gender, education level, follow up interval, gray matter volume, mean FD, as well as global correlation (GCOR). Pearson\u2019s correlation was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the longitudinal changes in CA subregional FC and neuropsychological performance in aMCI subjects.Results: Resting state FC between the right CA1 and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) as well as between the left CA2 and bilateral cuneal cortex (CC) were decreased in aMCI subjects as compared to HC. Longitudinal decrease in FC between the right CA1 and right MTG was correlated with reduced capacity of episodic memory in aMCI subjects.Conclusion: The current findings suggest functional alterations in the CA subregions. CA1 connectivity with the middle temporal cortex may represent an important neural marker of memory dysfunction in aMCI.", "title": "Disrupted Functional Connectivity of Cornu Ammonis Subregions in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Longitudinal Resting-State fMRI Study"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-10-29T11:23:55Z", "id": "00b2fe551a114052bc689b07fae4b539"}, {"last_updated": "2020-11-25T04:10:33Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2297-900X", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fcomm.2020.576840", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "5", "country": "CH", "license": [{"open_access": true, "title": "CC BY", "type": "CC BY", "url": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/communication#about"}], "issns": ["2297-900X"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Communication"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["neurocinematics", "fMRI", "suspense", "Hitchcock", "brain"], "year": "2020", "subject": [{"code": "P87-96", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Communication.

For reliable data entry of studies targeting at gait and posture improvement, uniform quantitative biomarkers are necessary. Until now, the pediatric test construct of gait and posture scores of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia sub-scale (SARA) is still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to validate the construct validity and reliability of the pediatric (SARAGAIT/POSTURE) sub-scale.Methods: We included 28 EOA patients [15.5 (6\u201334) years; median (range)]. For inter-observer reliability, we determined the ICC on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores by three independent pediatric neurologists. For convergent validity, we associated SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores with: (1) Ataxic gait Severity Measurement by Klockgether (ASMK; dynamic balance), (2) Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS; static balance), (3) Gross Motor Function Classification Scale -extended and revised version (GMFCS-E&amp;R), (4) SARA-kinetic scores (SARAKINETIC; kinetic function of the upper and lower limbs), (5) Archimedes Spiral (AS; kinetic function of the upper limbs), and (6) total SARA scores (SARATOTAL; i.e., summed SARAGAIT/POSTURE, SARAKINETIC, and SARASPEECH sub-scores). For discriminant validity, we investigated whether EOA co-morbidity factors (myopathy and myoclonus) could influence SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores.Results: The inter-observer agreement (ICC) on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores was high (0.97). SARAGAIT/POSTURE was strongly correlated with the other ataxia and functional scales [ASMK (rs = -0.819; p &lt; 0.001); PBS (rs = -0.943; p &lt; 0.001); GMFCS-E&amp;R (rs = -0.862; p &lt; 0.001); SARAKINETIC (rs = 0.726; p &lt; 0.001); AS (rs = 0.609; p = 0.002); and SARATOTAL (rs = 0.935; p &lt; 0.001)]. Comorbid myopathy influenced SARAGAIT/POSTURE scores by concurrent muscle weakness, whereas comorbid myoclonus predominantly influenced SARAKINETIC scores.Conclusion: In young EOA patients, separate SARAGAIT/POSTURE parameters reveal a good inter-observer agreement and convergent validity, implicating the reliability of the scale.

The relative amplitudes of suppression and rebound correlated strongly between MEG and EEG recordings. However, the relative strength of suppression and rebound in the contralateral hemisphere (with respect to the stimulated hand) was significantly stronger in MEG than in EEG recordings.Our results indicate that MEG recordings produced signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG, favoring MEG as an optimal tool for studies evaluating sensorimotor cortical functions.

Recent studies suggest improvement in cognitive speed, attention and executive functioning with physical activity. However, whether such improvements are activity specific is unclear.Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of one year age-adapted Taekwondo training on several cognitive functions, including reaction/ motor time, information processing speed, and working and executive memory, in 24 healthy volunteers over forty.Reaction and motor time decreased with 41.2 seconds and 18.4 seconds (p=0.004, p=0.015), respectively. Digit symbol coding task improved with a mean of 3.7 digits (p=0.017). Digit span, letter fluency, and trail making test task-completion-time all improved, but not statistically significant. The questionnaire reported better reaction time in 10 and unchanged in 9 of the nineteen study compliers. In conclusion, our data suggest that age-adapted Taekwondo training improves various aspects of cognitive function in people over 40, which may, therefore, offer a cheap, safe and enjoyable way to mitigate age-related cognitive decline.", "title": "Cognition improvement in Taekwondo novices over forty.
