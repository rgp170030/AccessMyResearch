Currently, comprehensive analysis and research of quality standards and quality assessment methods for big data are lacking. First, this paper summarizes reviews of data quality research. Second, this paper analyzes the data characteristics of the big data environment, presents quality challenges faced by big data, and formulates a hierarchical data quality framework from the perspective of data users. This framework consists of big data quality dimensions, quality characteristics, and quality indexes. Finally, on the basis of this framework, this paper constructs a dynamic assessment process for data quality. This process has good expansibility and adaptability and can meet the needs of big data quality assessment.

Educators must teach young people relevant information and skills not only to give them a chance to explore and understand the world around them but also to familiarize them with digital technologies. But before we can educate young people we must empower teachers using digital technology. Because teachers who use digital technologies appropriately are not only good models but also help students develop positive attitudes towards such technologies. Considering that, the purpose of this study is to determine the levels of teachers\u2019 digital enpowerment. Descriptive methods were used in this study to determine current level of teachers\u2019 digital empowerment. It was found that teachers have average levels of digital enpowerment. Looking closer at sub-categories, it was found that their awareness and motivation levels were higher, however, technical access and empowerment levels were average. Comparing males and females showed that both teachers had high scores on awareness and technical access but motivation, empowerment, and over all males and females were roughly average. When sub\u00adcategories of digital empowerment was analyzed according to teachers\u2019 specialties, it showed that Computer and Science teachers\u2019 had high scores on awareness, motivation, technical access empowerment and overall average.

The architecture of confusion and diffusion is adopted. Firstly, the surrounding of a plaintext image is surrounded by a sequence generated from the SHA-256 hash value of the plaintext to ensure that each encrypted result is different. Secondly, the image is scrambled according to the random sequence obtained by adding the disturbance term associated with the plaintext to the chaotic sequence. Third, the cyphertext (plaintext) feedback mechanism of the dynamic index in the diffusion stage is adopted, that is, the location index of the cyphertext (plaintext) used for feedback is dynamic. The above measures can ensure that the algorithm can resist chosen plaintext attacks and can overcome the difficulty of key management in &ldquo;one time pad&rdquo; encryption scheme.

In this mode, train attendants observe the railway condition ahead using the traditional manual method and tell the observation results to the driver in order to avoid danger. To address this problem, an automatic object detection system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to detect objects ahead in shunting mode, which is called Feature Fusion Refine neural network (FR-Net). It consists of three connected modules, i.e., the depthwise-pointwise convolution, the coarse detection module, and the object detection module. Depth-wise-pointwise convolutions are used to improve the detection in real time. The coarse detection module coarsely refine the locations and sizes of prior anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent module and also reduces search space for the classification, whereas the object detection module aims to regress accurate object locations and predict the class labels for the prior anchors. The experimental results on the railway traffic dataset show that FR-Net achieves 0.8953 mAP with 72.3 FPS performance on a machine with a GeForce GTX1080Ti with the input size of 320 &times; 320 pixels.

Most container terminals use yard cranes to transfer containers between the yard and trucks (both external and internal).

This paper investigated an agent-based approach to assign and relocate yard cranes among yard blocks based on the forecasted work volumes. The goal of our study is to reduce the work volume that remains incomplete at the end of a planning period. We offered several preference functions for yard cranes and blocks which are modeled as agents. These preference functions are designed to find effective schedules for yard cranes.

Self-organizing map (SOM) has been successfully utilized to cluster a dataset into subsets containing similar data points. These subsets are then used to train the forecasting models to improve forecasting accuracy.

While considerable research has focused on ORN responses to odorants, the mechanisms by which olfactory information is encoded in the activities of ORNs and translated into navigational behavior remain poorly understood. We sought to determine the contributions of most Drosophila melanogaster larval ORNs to navigational behavior. Using odorants to activate ORNs and a larval tracking assay to measure the corresponding behavioral response, we observed that larval ORN activators cluster into four groups based on the behavior responses elicited from larvae. This is significant because it provides new insights into the functional relationship between ORN activity and behavioral response. Subsequent optogenetic analyses of a subset of ORNs revealed previously undescribed properties of larval ORNs. Furthermore, our results indicated that different temporal patterns of ORN activation elicit different behavioral outputs: some ORNs respond to stimulus increments while others respond to stimulus decrements. These results suggest that the ability of ORNs to encode temporal patterns of stimulation increases the coding capacity of the olfactory circuit. Moreover, the ability of ORNs to sense stimulus increments and decrements facilitates instantaneous evaluations of concentration changes in the environment. Together, these ORN properties enable larvae to efficiently navigate a complex olfactory environment. Ultimately, knowledge of how ORN activity patterns and their weighted contributions influence odor coding may eventually reveal how peripheral information is organized and transmitted to subsequent layers of a neural circuit.", "datePublished": "2018-12-21T04:49:01Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00324/full"], "eissn": "1662-5153", "doi": "10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00324", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Water mites (Acari, Hydrachnidia) of riparian springs in a small lowland river valley: what are the key factors for species distribution?", "author": ["Andrzej Zawal", "Robert Stryjecki", "Edyta Buczy\u0144ska", "Pawe\u0142 Buczy\u0144ski", "Joanna Pakulnicka", "Aleksandra Ba\u0144kowska", "Tomasz Czernicki", "Katarzyna Janusz", "Agnieszka Szlauer-\u0141ukaszewska", "Vladimir Pe\u0161i\u0107"], "description": "This paper examines the impact of disturbance factors\u2014flooding and intermittency\u2014on the distribution of water mites in the riparian springs situated in the valley of a small lowland river, the Kr\u0105piel.

Methysergide, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, blocked the excitatory effect of quipazine on swallowing, but had no effect on spontaneous swallow rate. Microinjections of quipazine in the nucleus of the solitary tract were without effect. In contrast, similar injections in caudal medullary raphe nuclei increased swallow rate without changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. Thus, quipazine may exert an excitatory effect on raphe neurons via stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors, leading to increased excitability of the swallowing network. In conclusion, we suggest that pharmacological stimulation of swallowing by quipazine in situ represents a valuable model for experimental studies. This work paves the way for future investigations on brainstem serotonergic modulation, and further identification of neural populations and mechanisms involved in swallowing and/or swallow-breathing interaction.", "datePublished": "2020-07-21T00:01:46Z", "url": ["https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/14/5120"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21145120", "eissn": "1422-0067", "pissn": "1661-6596", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Spacing Allocation Method for Vehicular Platoon: A Cooperative Game Theory Approach", "author": ["Yang Liu", "Changfu Zong", "Xiaojian Han", "Dong Zhang", "Hongyu Zheng", "Chunmei Shi"], "description": "Recently, spacing policies of the vehicular platoon have been widely developed to enhance safety, traffic efficiency, and fuel consumption.

Cofilin-1 (CFL-1) and its modulators, LIMK1/SSH1, play key roles in mediating the invasiveness by driving actin cytoskeleton reorganization in various cancer types. However, their clinical significance and prognostic value in CRC has not been fully explored. Here, we evaluated the clinical contribution of these actin regulators according to TNM and consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) classification. Methods CFL-1, LIMK1 and SSH1 mRNA/protein levels were assessed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses using normal adjacent and tumor tissues obtained from a clinical cohort of CRC patients. The expression levels of these proteins were associated with clinicopathological features by using the chi square test. In addition, using RNA-Seq data of CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we determine how these actin regulators are expressed and distributed according to TNM and CMSs classification. Based on gene expression profiling, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to evaluated overall survival. Results Bioinformatic analysis revealed that LIMK1 expression was upregulated in all tumor stages. Patients with high levels of LIMK1 demonstrated significantly lower overall survival rates and exhibited greater lymph node metastatic potential in a clinical cohort. In contrast, CFL-1 and SSH1 have expression downregulated in all tumor stages. However, immunohistochemical analyses showed that patients with high protein levels of CFL-1 and SSH1 exhibited greater lymph node metastatic potential and greater depth of local invasion. In addition, using the CMSs classification to evaluate different biological phenotypes of CRC, we observed that LIMK1 and SSH1 genes are upregulated in immune (CMS1) and mesenchymal (CMS4) subtypes. However, patients with high levels of LIMK1 also demonstrated significantly lower overall survival rates in canonical (CMS2), and metabolic (CMS3) subtypes. Conclusions We demonstrated that CFL-1 and its modulators, LIMK1/SSH1, are differentially expressed and associated with lymph node metastasis in CRC.

To date most studies have focussed on C. sakazakii as it is the major species associated with neonatal infections. However, recently C. malonaticus, in particular sequence type 7 (ST7), has been noted as being prevalent in adult infections and therefore warranting further investigation. In this study, eight strains of C. malonaticus ST7, that had been isolated from a wide range of sources and varied in their in vitro virulence, were chosen for proteomic analysis of their outer membrane proteins (OMPs). One-dimensional gel analysis revealed a ~29 kDa size band that was only present in the highly invasive strains. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis identified several peptides that matched the flagellin protein. The presence of flagellin protein was confirmed in 2D gel spot. Mass spectrometry analysis of total OMPs revealed that the four highly invasive C. malonaticus strains expressed the main flagellum proteins that were absent from the four low invasive strains. These were the flagellar hook protein FlgE, flagellar hook-associated protein 1, flagellar hook-associated protein, flagellin, and flagellar hook-filament junction protein FlgL.

Two sand fly genera, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia,\u00a0contain species that are present in the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus where the visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) and canine (CanLei) leishmaniases are a public health concern. The risk of transmission of different Leishmania species can be studied in an area by monitoring their vectors. Sand fly species are traditionally identified using morphological characteristics but minute differences between individuals or populations could be overlooked leading to wrong epidemiological predictions. Molecular identification of these important vectors has become, therefore, an essential tool for research tasks concerning their geographical distribution which directly relates to leishmaniasis control efforts. DNA barcoding is a widely used molecular identification method for cataloguing animal species by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome oxidase I. Results DNA barcoding was used to identify individuals of five sand fly species (Phlebotomus papatasi, P. similis, P. killicki, Sergentomyia minuta, S. dentata) circulating in the islands of Crete and Cyprus during the years 2011\u20132014. Phlebotomus papatasi is a known vector of zoonotic CL in the Middle East and it is found in both islands. Phlebotomus similis is the suspected vector of Leishmania tropica in Greece causing anthroponotic CL. Phlebotomus killicki was collected in Cyprus for the first time. Sergentomyia minuta, found to present intraspecific diversity, is discussed for its potential as a Leishmania vector. Molecular identification was consistent with the morphological identification. It successfully identified males and females, which is difficult when using only morphological characters. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the barcodes acquired, representing their genetic relationships along with other species from the area studied.

This function of Hrs in cholesterol transport is distinct from its previously defined role in lysosomal sorting and downregulation of membrane receptors via the ESCRT pathway. In line with this, knocking down other ESCRT proteins does not cause prominent endosomal cholesterol accumulation. Importantly, the localization and biochemical properties of key cholesterol-sorting proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, appear to be unchanged upon Hrs knockdown.

However, the structural analysis of the antibiotic complex derived from S. roseoflavus INA-Ac-5812 is still ongoing. The mechanism of action of 5812-A/C was assessed in comparison with its most related analog, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin, given the presence in both antimicrobials of an L-kynurenine amino acid residue. The inhibitory activity of 5812-A/C against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus was similar to daptomycin. The mechanism of action of 5812-A/C was associated with the disruption of membrane integrity, which differs in comparison with daptomycin and is most similar to the antimicrobial membrane-disturbing peptides. However, 5812-A/C demonstrated a calcium-dependent mode of action. In addition, unlike daptomycin, 5812-A/C was able to penetrate mature biofilms and inhibit the metabolic activity of embedded S. aureus cells. At the same time, 5812-A/C has no hemolytic activity toward erythrocyte, but possessed weak cytotoxic activity represented by heterochromatin condensation in human buccal epithelium cells.

Hundreds of these loci have been detected, but only a small number of the underlying causative genes have been identified. The main difficulty is the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in intercross progeny and the slow process of fine-scale mapping by traditional methods. Recently, new approaches have been introduced, such as association studies with inbred lines and multigenerational crosses. These approaches are very useful for interval reduction, but generally do not provide single-gene resolution because of strong LD extending over one to several megabases. Here, we investigate the genetic structure of a natural population of mice in Arizona to determine its suitability for fine-scale LD mapping and association studies. There are three main findings: (1) Arizona mice have a high level of genetic variation, which includes a large fraction of the sequence variation present in classical strains of laboratory mice; (2) they show clear evidence of local inbreeding but appear to lack stable population structure across the study area; and (3) LD decays with distance at a rate similar to human populations, which is considerably more rapid than in laboratory populations of mice. Strong associations in Arizona mice are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart, which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes. Although other considerations, such as sample size requirements and marker discovery, are serious issues in the implementation of association studies, the genetic variation and LD results indicate that wild mice could provide a useful tool for identifying genes that cause variation in complex traits.", "datePublished": "2016-06-14T05:53:32Z", "url": ["http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1950958?pdf=render"], "pissn": "1553-7390", "eissn": "1553-7404", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.0030144", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Forecasting Warping Deformation Using Multivariate Thermal Time Series and K-Nearest Neighbors in Fused Deposition Modeling", "author": ["Donghwan Song", "Adrian  Matias Chung Baek", "Jageon Koo", "Moise Busogi", "Namhun Kim"], "description": "Over the past decades, additive manufacturing has rapidly advanced due to its advantages in enabling diverse material usage and complex design production.

This study utilized a variety of thermal time series data and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with dynamic time warping (DTW) to detect and predict the warping deformation in the printed parts using fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers. Multivariate thermal time series data extracted from thermocouples were trained using DTW-based KNN to classify warping deformation.

This susceptibility may in part be caused by changes to the epigenetic landscape which consequently affect gene expression and lead to changes in lipid metabolism. The epigenetic modifier enhancer of zeste 2 (Ezh2) is a histone H3K27 methyltransferase implicated to play a role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. In this study, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the role of Ezh2 on lipid metabolism and chromatin status following developmental exposure to the Ezh1/2 inhibitor PF-06726304 acetate. We used the environmental chemical tributyltin (TBT) as a positive control, as this chemical is known to act on lipid metabolism via EZH-mediated pathways in mammals. Results Zebrafish embryos (0\u20135\u00a0days post-fertilization, dpf) exposed to non-toxic concentrations of PF-06726304 acetate (5\u00a0\u03bcM) and TBT (1\u00a0nM) exhibited increased lipid accumulation. Changes in chromatin were analyzed by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) at 50% epiboly (5.5 hpf). We observed 349 altered chromatin regions, predominantly located at H3K27me3 loci and mostly more open chromatin in the exposed samples. Genes associated to these loci were linked to metabolic pathways. In addition, a selection of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, adipogenesis and genes specifically targeted by PF-06726304 acetate via altered chromatin accessibility were differentially expressed after TBT and PF-06726304 acetate exposure at 5 dpf, but not at 50% epiboly stage. One gene, cebpa, did not show a change in chromatin, but did show a change in gene expression at 5 dpf. Interestingly, underlying H3K27me3 marks were significantly decreased at this locus at 50% epiboly. Conclusions Here, we show for the first time the applicability of ATAC-seq as a tool to investigate toxicological responses in zebrafish. Our analysis indicates that Ezh2 inhibition leads to a partial primed state of chromatin linked to metabolic pathways which results in gene expression changes later in development, leading to enhanced lipid accumulation. Although ATAC-seq seems promising, our in-depth assessment of the cebpa locus indicates that we need to consider underlying epigenetic marks as well.", "datePublished": "2020-02-16T12:30:19Z", "url": ["https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-020-0329-y"], "doi": "10.1186/s13072-020-0329-y", "eissn": "1756-8935", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Features of reproduction of the shrub vole <i>Microtus majori</i> Thomas, 1906 in natural conditions", "author": ["R.

The human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii possesses at least four enzymes which generate acetyl-CoA in the nucleo-cytosol (acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS); ATP citrate lyase (ACL)), mitochondrion (branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase-complex (BCKDH)) and apicoplast (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)). Given the diverse functions of acetyl-CoA, we know very little about the role of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools in parasite physiology. Results To assess the importance and functions of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA-pools, we measured the acetylome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of parasites lacking ACL/ACS or BCKDH. We demonstrate that ACL/ACS constitute a synthetic lethal pair. Loss of both enzymes causes a halt in fatty acid elongation, hypo-acetylation of nucleo-cytosolic and secretory proteins and broad changes in gene expression. In contrast, loss of BCKDH results in an altered TCA cycle, hypo-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins and few specific changes in gene expression. We provide evidence that changes in the acetylome, transcriptome and proteome of cells lacking BCKDH enable the metabolic adaptations and thus the survival of these parasites. Conclusions Using multi-omics and molecular tools, we obtain a global and integrative picture of the role of distinct acetyl-CoA pools in T. gondii physiology. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is essential and is required for the synthesis of parasite-specific fatty acids. In contrast, loss of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA can be compensated for through metabolic adaptations implemented at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational level.", "datePublished": "2020-06-21T12:24:34Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-020-00791-7"], "doi": "10.1186/s12915-020-00791-7", "eissn": "1741-7007", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "The Holo-Transcriptome of the Zoantharian Protopalythoa variabilis (Cnidaria: Anthozoa): A Plentiful Source of Enzymes for Potential Application in Green Chemistry, Industrial and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology", "author": ["Jean-\u00c9tienne R.

Our results indicated the predictive expression of thirteen multifunctional enzymes and 694 enzyme sequences with partially characterized activities, distributed in 23 sub-subclasses.

Their use commonly focuses on changes in population abundance and individual sizes in response to environmental change. These numerical and demographic shifts likely have behavioral and physiological mechanistic drivers that, if understood, could provide additional insights into the use of these species as bioindicators of habitat health. The Atlantic ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata, is a global bioindicator species of human disturbance on sandy shores. Individual size and population abundance of O.\u00a0quadrata decline dramatically at sites with human disturbance, and the causes of this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual and population\u2010level changes at disturbed sites reflect changes in burrowing behavior and energetics. Specifically, we examine whether or not the burrowing behavior (e.g., burrow fidelity and longevity) of O.\u00a0quadrata changes because of human disturbance. We also examine energy required for burrowing by O.\u00a0quadrata across different levels of human disturbance. We show that O.\u00a0quadrata have the highest burrow fidelity and longevity at sites with low level of human impact, and weakest burrow fidelity and longevity at pristine sites. O.\u00a0quadrata reduce the burrowing energy allocation by manipulating the burrow dimension and increasing the burrow longevity even under low levels of human disturbance. Overall, this study shows that human disturbances not only change the behavior of organisms, but also shift energetic balance. Our results support the use of a bioenergetic approach to better understand how human disturbances influence natural populations, and the specific use of this approach with this bioindicator species.", "datePublished": "2020-01-10T15:39:54Z", "url": ["https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5853"], "eissn": "2045-7758", "doi": "10.1002/ece3.5853", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Transcriptome and DNA Methylome Analysis in a Mouse Model of Diet-Induced Obesity Predicts Increased Risk of Colorectal Cancer", "author": ["Ruifang Li", "Sara A.

Telomere biology disorders encompass a growing spectrum of conditions caused by rare pathogenic germline variants in genes encoding essential aspects of telomere function. Dyskeratosis congenita, a disorder at the severe end of this spectrum, typically presents in childhood with the classic triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, accompanied by a very high risk of bone marrow failure, cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, and other medical problems. In contrast, the less severe end of the telomere biology disorder spectrum consists of middle-age or older adults with just one feature typically seen in dyskeratosis congenita, such as pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. In the common disease realm, large-scale molecular epidemiology studies have discovered novel associations between illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and mental health, and both telomere length and common genetic variants in telomere biology genes.

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.", "datePublished": "2016-06-14T15:59:23Z", "url": ["http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2958806?pdf=render"], "pissn": "1553-7366", "eissn": "1553-7374", "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1001157", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome", "author": ["Florian K\u00f6hler", "Felix Bormann", "G\u00fcnter Raddatz", "Julian Gutekunst", "Samuel Corless", "Tanja Musch", "Anke S.

Cells from affected individuals express a mutant version of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A (termed progerin) and have previously been shown to exhibit prominent histone modification changes. Methods Here, we analyze the possibility that epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) is involved in the molecular pathology of HGPS. To do so, we studied chromatin accessibility (Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-see/-seq), DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips), and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of nine primary HGPS fibroblast cell lines and six additional controls, two parental and four age-matched healthy fibroblast cell lines. Results Our ATAC-see/-seq data demonstrate that primary dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients exhibit chromatin accessibility changes that are enriched in LADs. Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip profiling further reveals that DNA methylation alterations observed in HGPS fibroblasts are similarly enriched in LADs and different from those occurring during healthy aging and Werner syndrome (WS), another premature aging disease. Moreover, HGPS patients can be stratified into two different subgroups according to their DNA methylation profiles. Finally, we show that the epigenetic deregulation of LADs is associated with HGPS-specific gene expression changes. Conclusions Taken together, our results strongly implicate epigenetic deregulation of LADs as an important and previously unrecognized feature of HGPS, which contributes to disease-specific gene expression.

The distribution of sodium, potassium cations and water in skeletal muscles, myocardium, smooth muscle elements of the vascular system, liver and skin of mini-pigs differing in gender and behavioral response to humans has been studied. Quantitative determination of sodium and potassium cations was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that skeletal and smooth muscles differ in electrolyte content.

There has been no information on the status of co-infections of tuberculosis and parasitosis in Oromia Zone of Amhara Region and South Wollo, Ethiopia. Hence, this study primarily focuses on determining the status of tuberculosis and parasitosis co-infections and associated factors. Methods The study was conducted in Oromia Special Zone of the Amhara Regional State and South Wollo Zone, northeastern Ethiopia from April 2015 to January 2017. Tuberculosis cases confirmed by health personnel at the health institutions were the source of the study sample. In a cross-sectional study 384 smear positive pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases were recruited. Faecal specimens provided by the study participants were examined for parasitic co-infections using direct saline microscopic test, Kato-Katz and concentration techniques. Nutritional status was determined using body mass index and mid-upper arm circumferences. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and Pearson chi-square. Results Tuberculosis and parasitosis co-infection prevalence was 10.8%, and the proportion of intestinal helminths accounted for 9.7% while intestinal protozoa accounted for 1.9%. Cases with single parasitic infection was 89.3% among co-infected individuals. Co-infection of both disease was not significantly associated with gender and age (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The prevalence of undernutrition was 58.6% as determined using body mass index and 73.0% as determined using mid-upper arm circumference with no significant association with gender. Among all forms of tuberculosis cases (384) screened for the study, the bacterial positivity was relatively more common in males (55.5%) than females (44.5%). Tuberculosis lymphadenitis was found to be the most prevalent (85.9%) form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis with cervical adenopathy (75.3%) being the commonly existing disease. Conclusions The rate of helminthic co-infection is predominantly high than that of intestinal protozoa. Single parasitic co-infection was more common than double or multiple co-infections. Both body mass index and mid-upper arm circumference anthropometric parameters revealed greater risk of undernutrition in tuberculosis patients.

Among microbial symbionts, integrating genetic species delimitation methods with trait data that could indicate reproductive isolation, such as host specificity data, has rarely been used despite its potential to inform species limits. Here we test the ability of an integrative approach combining genetic and host specificity data to delimit species within the avian malaria parasite genus Leucocytozoon in central Alaska. Results We sequenced seven nuclear loci for 69 Leucocytozoon samples and used multiple species delimitation methods (GMYC and BPP models), tested for differences in host infection patterns among putative species based on 406 individual infections, and characterized parasite morphology. We found that cryptic morphology has masked a highly diverse Leucocytozoon assemblage, with most species delimitation methods recovering support for at least 21 separate species that occur sympatrically and have divergent host infection patterns. Reproductive isolation among putative species appears to have evolved despite low mtDNA divergence, and in one instance two Leucocytozoon cytb haplotypes that differed by a single base pair (~\u20090.2% divergence) were supported as separate species. However, there was no consistent association between mtDNA divergence and species limits. Among cytb haplotypes that differed by one to three base pairs we observed idiosyncratic patterns of nuclear and ecological divergence, with cytb haplotype pairs found to be either conspecific, reproductively isolated with no divergence in host specificity, or reproductively isolated with divergent patterns of host specialization. Conclusion Integrating multi-locus genetic species delimitation methods and non-traditional ecological data types such as host specificity provide a novel view of the diversity of avian malaria parasites that has been missed previously using morphology and mtDNA barcodes. Species delimitation methods show that Leucocytozoon is highly species-rich in Alaska, and the genus is likely to harbor extraordinary species-level diversity worldwide.

Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC.

SelenoN knockout (KO) mouse limb muscles, however, are protected from the disease, and display no major alterations in muscle histology or contractile properties. Interestingly, we find that the highly active diaphragm muscle shows impaired force production, in line with the human phenotype. In addition, after repeated stimulation with a protocol which induces muscle fatigue, also hind limb muscles show altered relaxation times. Mechanistically, muscle SELENON loss alters activity-dependent calcium handling selectively impinging on the Ca2+ uptake of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and elicits an ER stress response, including the expression of the maladaptive CHOP-induced ERO1. In SELENON-devoid models, ERO1 shifts ER redox to a more oxidised poise, and further affects Ca2+ uptake. Importantly, CHOP ablation in SelenoN KO mice completely prevents diaphragm dysfunction, the prolonged limb muscle relaxation after fatigue, and restores Ca2+ uptake by attenuating the induction of ERO1.

The primary reason is that there is presently no effective treatment option, especially for radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome. This syndrome results from disruption of mucosal barrier integrity leading to severe dehydration, blood loss, and sepsis. In this study, we tested whether extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) could reduce radiation-related mucosal barrier damage and reduce radiation-induced animal mortality. Methods Human MSC-derived extracellular vesicles were intravenously administered to NUDE mice, 3, 24, and 48\u2009h after lethal whole-body irradiation (10\u2009Gy). Integrity of the small intestine epithelial barrier was assessed by morphologic analysis, immunostaining for tight junction protein (claudin-3), and in vivo permeability to 4\u2009kDa FITC-labeled dextran. Renewal of the small intestinal epithelium was determined by quantifying epithelial cell apoptosis (TUNEL staining) and proliferation (Ki67 immunostaining). Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test. Statistical analyses of mouse survival were performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods. Results We demonstrated that MSC-derived extracellular vesicle treatment reduced by 85% the instantaneous mortality risk in mice subjected to 10\u2009Gy whole-body irradiation and so increased their survival time. This effect could be attributed to the efficacy of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles in reducing mucosal barrier disruption. We showed that the MSC-derived extracellular vesicles improved the renewal of the small intestinal epithelium by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of the epithelial crypt cells. The MSC-derived extracellular vesicles also reduced radiation-induced mucosal permeability as evidenced by the preservation of claudin-3 immunostaining at the tight junctions of the epithelium. Conclusions MSC-derived extracellular vesicles promote epithelial repair and regeneration and preserve structural integrity of the intestinal epithelium in mice exposed to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Our results suggest that the administration of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles could be an effective therapy for limiting acute radiation syndrome.", "datePublished": "2020-08-30T12:09:12Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13287-020-01887-1"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-020-01887-1", "eissn": "1757-6512", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Abnormal X : autosome ratio, but normal X chromosome inactivation in human triploid cultures", "author": ["Norwood Thomas H", "Luo Ping", "Varadarajan Kartik R", "Gartler Stanley M", "Canfield Theresa K", "Hansen R Scott"], "description": "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is that aspect of mammalian dosage compensation that brings about equivalence of X-linked gene expression between females and males by inactivating one of the two X chromosomes (Xi) in normal female cells, leaving them with a single active X (Xa) as in male cells.

Results: The rate of head movement in participants with schizophrenia (1.48 mm/frame) and those without differed significantly (2.50 mm/frame; p = 0.01), and a logistic regression demonstrated that head movement was a significant predictor of schizophrenia diagnosis (p = 0.02).

The tribe is endemic to southern Africa, confined chiefly to the southwestern South Africa, home of two biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region and Succulent Karoo). The monospecific Chamira (C. circaeoides), the only crucifer species with persistent cotyledons, is traditionally retrieved as the closest relative of Heliophileae. Our transcriptome analysis revealed a whole-genome duplication (WGD) \u223c26.15\u201329.20 million years ago, presumably preceding the Chamira/Heliophila split. The WGD was then followed by genome-wide diploidization, species radiations, and cladogenesis in Heliophila. The expanded phylogeny based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) uncovered four major infrageneric clades (A\u2013D) in Heliophila and corroborated the sister relationship between Chamira and Heliophila. Herein, we analyzed how the diploidization process impacted the evolution of repetitive sequences through low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 15 Heliophila species, representing the four clades, and Chamira. Despite the firmly established infrageneric cladogenesis and different ecological life histories (four perennials vs. 11 annual species), repeatome analysis showed overall comparable evolution of genome sizes (288\u2013484 Mb) and repeat content (25.04\u201338.90%) across Heliophila species and clades. Among Heliophila species, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were the predominant components of the analyzed genomes (11.51\u201322.42%), whereas tandem repeats had lower abundances (1.03\u201312.10%). In Chamira, the tandem repeat content (17.92%, 16 diverse tandem repeats) equals the abundance of LTR retrotransposons (16.69%). Among the 108 tandem repeats identified in Heliophila, only 16 repeats were found to be shared among two or more species; no tandem repeats were shared by Chamira and Heliophila genomes. Six \u201crelic\u201d tandem repeats were shared between any two different Heliophila clades by a common descent. Four and six clade-specific repeats shared among clade A and C species, respectively, support the monophyly of these two clades. Three repeats shared by all clade A species corroborate the recent diversification of this clade revealed by plastome-based molecular dating. Phylogenetic analysis based on repeat sequence similarities separated the Heliophila species to three clades [A, C, and (B+D)], mirroring the post-polyploid cladogenesis in Heliophila inferred from rDNA ITS and plastome sequences.", "datePublished": "2021-01-12T05:28:13Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.607893/full"], "eissn": "1664-462X", "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2020.607893", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Dissection of Leaf Angle Variation in Maize through Genetic Mapping and Meta-Analysis", "author": ["Matthew J.

In many psychiatric disorders, including social anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders, depression and schizophrenia social behavior is severely impaired. Selective targeting of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) has emerged as a novel treatment strategy for these disorders. In this review, we describe some of the behavioral paradigms used to assess different types of social behavior, such as social interaction, social memory, aggressive behavior and sexual behavior. We then focus on the effects of pharmacological modulation of mGluR1-8 on these types of social behavior. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates beneficial effects of selective ligands of specific mGluRs in ameliorating innate or pharmacologically-induced deficits in social interaction and social memory as well as in reducing aggression in rodents.

However, the energy-rich trophic subsidy that aquaculture provides may create cascades with influences over broader spatial scales. In a fjord region with intensive fish farming, we tested whether an ecosystem engineer, the white urchin Gracilechinus acutus, was more abundant at aquaculture sites than control sites. Further, we tested whether diets influenced by aquaculture waste altered reproductive outputs compared with natural diets. Urchins formed barrens at aquaculture sites where they were 10 times more abundant (38 urchins m-2) than at control sites (4 urchins m-2). Urchins were on average 15 mm larger at control sites. In the laboratory, urchins fed aquafeed diets had 3 times larger gonad indices than urchins fed a natural diet. However, their reproduction was compromised. Eggs from females fed an aquafeed diet had 13% lower fertilisation success and 30% lower larval survival rates at 10 d compared with females fed a natural diet. A reproductive output model showed that enhanced numbers of 10 d old larvae produced by the dense aquaculture-associated aggregations of G. acutus will supersede any detrimental effects on reproduction, with larval outputs from aquaculture sites being on average 5 times greater than control sites. The results show that aquaculture waste can act as a trophic subsidy in fjord ecosystems, stimulating aggregations of urchins and promoting the formation of urchin barrens.

Risk stratification is crucial for the choice of the optimal therapy in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), affecting elderly subjects with coexistent diseases. Our aim was to assess correlates and prognostic value of circulating Gal-3 in real-world patients with degenerative AS referred for invasive treatment. Gal-3 levels were measured at admission in 80 consecutive patients with symptomatic degenerative AS (mean age: 79 \u00b1 8 years; aortic valve area (AVA) index: 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 cm2/m2). The therapeutic strategy was chosen following a dedicated multidisciplinary team-oriented approach, including surgical valve replacement (n = 11), transcatheter valve implantation (n = 19), balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) (n = 25) and optimal medical therapy (n = 25). Besides routine echocardiographic indices, valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva), an index of global LV afterload, was computed. There were 22 deaths over a median follow-up of 523 days. Baseline Gal-3 correlated negatively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r = \u22120.61, p &lt; 0.001) and was unrelated to age, symptomatic status, AVA index, LV ejection fraction, LV mass index or Zva.

However, in post-BAV patients multivariate-adjusted pre-procedural Gal-3 was associated with worse survival (HR: 7.41 (1.52\u201336.1), p = 0.01) regardless of eGFR. In conclusion, the inverse eGFR\u2013Gal-3 relationship underlies a weak association between Gal-3 and adverse outcome in patients with degenerative AS referred for invasive therapy irrespective of type of treatment employed.

Among many different types of GAN, the proposed method is performed using the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGANGP). Since edge information is the most important factor in an image, the style loss function is applied to represent the perceptual information of the edge in order to preserve small edge information and capture its perceptual similarity. As a result, the proposed method improves the similarity between sharp and blurred images by minimizing the Wasserstein distance, and it captures well the perceptual similarity using the style loss function, considering the correlation of features in the convolutional neural network (CNN). To confirm the performance of the proposed method, three experiments are conducted using two datasets: the GOPRO Large and Kohler dataset.

However, effect of heat treatment on phytohormone related genes/proteins/metabolites and possible relationship with dormancy release remains unclear in oil palm. In this study, oil palm seeds were heat-treated at 39\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009days according to the method for commercial production. The embryos of seeds during heat treatment (0 d, 15 d, 30 d, 45 d and 60 d) and of germinated seeds (70 d and 75 d) were selected to discover the mechanisms involved in oil palm seed germination. RNA-seq and iTRAQ were applied to investigate DEGs and DEPs related to seed germination; qPCR and western blot were used as validation accordingly; endogenous phytohormones were determined by LC-MS/MS and exogenous phytohormones were also applied to validate their effects on seed germination. Results RNA-seq results showed that plant hormone signal transduction was one of the most important pathways and eight phytohormones involved, while six of them (ABA, GA, ET, CTK, IAA and JA) were also identified by iTRAQ. Both RNA-seq and iTRAQ results showed that the expression of ABA decreased after heat treatment, which was further validated by qPCR and western blot. Furthermore, changes in endogenous phytohormones showed that ABA decreased rapidly to about 9% of the control at 30 d and then stayed at very low levels until germination; GA and CTK increased while IAA was not affected by heat treatment. Besides, exogenous ABA treatments (10, 100, 1000\u2009mg/L) showed that the germination rate decreased to 63, 42 and 16% of the control, respectively, suggesting that ABA suppress seed germination and the inhibition effect increase with higher concentration; while the germination rates of exogenous GA and IAA treatments barely changed among different concentrations. Conclusions Phytohormones are deeply involved in oil palm seed germination and ABA acts as an inhibitor. Heat treatment can eliminate endogenous ABA and break dormancy, while GA and CTK may also involve in dormancy release. At least 30\u2009days of heat treatment might be necessary.

Nevertheless, the enhancement of the successful removal of heavy metal ions by using different combinations of biosorbents is not generally guaranteed which leaves room to explore the application of the technique. In this study, the performance of free and immobilized forms of a yeast strain, Candida krusei (C. krusei), and calcium alginate (CaAlg) are evaluated for their ability to remove copper(II). Infrared spectroscopy, studies on the effects of pH and temperature, and kinetics and isotherm modelling are carried out to evaluate the biosorption. The infrared spectroscopy shows that the primary biosorption sites on the biosorbents are carboxylate groups. In addition, a higher pH and higher temperatures promote biosorption while a decline in biosorption ability is observed for C. krusei at 50\u2009\u00b0C. The kinetics study shows that C. krusei, CaAlg and immobilized C. krusei (MCaAlg) conform with good correlation to pseudo-second order kinetics. MCaAlg and CaAlg fit well to the Langmuir isotherm while C. krusei fits well to the Temkin isotherm.

They are cytotoxic cells involved in the rejection reaction between contacting, genetically incompatible colonies. Upon the recognition of foreign substances, they degranulate and release their content, which contribute to the cell death along the contact borders. A major role in MCrelated cytotoxicity is exerted by the enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) that converts polyphenol substrata to quinones which, then, polymerize to form melanins. During this reaction, reactive oxygen species are formed which are the cause of MC-related cytotoxicity. Here, we carried out new analyses to investigate further the nature of MC content and its role in cytotoxicity. Results confirm that PO is located inside MC vacuoles together with arylsulfatase, iron and polyphenols/quinones, the latter probably representing ready-to-use cytotoxic molecules, deriving from the oxidation of DOPAcontaining proteins. In addition, small DOPA-containing peptides, called tunichromes, are also present inside MCs. MC degranulation and PO-mediated cytotoxicity are prevented by secretion inhibitors and by H89 and calphostin C. The observation that PO activity is always detectable in MCs in the absence of protease treatment, and its inhibition by sulfites and sulfates, suggest a non-classical pathway of PO modulation in botryllid ascidians.\n", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T10:12:02Z", "url": ["https://isj02.unimore.it/index.php/ISJ/article/view/351"], "eissn": "1824-307X", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Ubiquitin Proteasome System in Stress and Disease", "author": ["Dmitry Karpov", "Michael H.

Here, we used an invasive plant Mikania micrantha, a co\u2010occurring native plant Coix lacryma\u2010jobi, and a native holoparasitic plant Cuscuta campestris to test whether parasitism on M.\u00a0micrantha interacts with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of the co\u2010occurring native plant.

However, it is unclear why stimulating brain activity would be effective for controlling hyperexcitability. Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis in these disorders exhibits a transition from an initial activity loss after acute injury or progressive neurodegeneration to subsequent development of hyperexcitability. This process mimics homeostatic activity regulation and may contribute to developing network hyperexcitability that underlies neurological symptoms. This hypothesis also predicts that stimulating brain activity should be effective in reducing hyperexcitability due to homeostatic activity regulation and in relieving symptoms.

This study aimed to investigate whether the nonselective A2 adenosine receptor agonist NECA induces cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury via glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Methods and Results. H9c2 cells were exposed to H2O2 for 20 minutes. NECA significantly prevented H2O2-induced TMRE fluorescence reduction, indicating that NECA inhibited the mPTP opening. NECA blocked H2O2-induced GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation and GRP94 expression. NECA increased GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation and decreased GRP94 expression, which were prevented by both ERS inductor 2-DG and PKG inhibitor KT5823, suggesting that NECA may induce cardioprotection through GSK-3\u03b2 and cGMP/PKG via ERS. In isolated rat hearts, both NECA and the ERS inhibitor TUDCA decreased myocardial infarction, increased GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, and reversed GRP94 expression at reperfusion, suggesting that NECA protected the heart by inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 and ERS. Transmission electron microscopy showed that NECA and TUDCA reduced mitochondrial swelling and endoplasmic reticulum expansion, further supporting that NECA protected the heart by preventing the mPTP opening and ERS. Conclusion. These data suggest that NECA prevents the mPTP opening through inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2 via ERS inhibition.

RNA interference mediated by short interfering RNAs and microRNAs (miRNA), is a widespread anti-viral defence strategy. Importantly, viruses also encode their own miRNAs. In recent times miRNAs were identified as key players in host-virus interaction. Furthermore, viruses were shown to exploit the host miRNA networks to suite their own need. The complex cross-talk between host and viral miRNAs and their cellular and viral targets forms the environment for viral pathogenesis. Apart from protein-coding mRNAs, non-coding RNAs may also be targeted by host or viral miRNAs in virus infected cells, and viruses can exploit the host miRNA mediated gene regulatory network via the competing endogenous RNA effect. A recent report showed that viral U-rich non-coding RNAs called HSUR, expressed in primate virus herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) infected T cells, were able to bind to three host miRNAs, causing significant alteration in cellular level for one of the miRNAs. We have predicted protein coding and non protein-coding targets for viral and human miRNAs in virus infected cells. We identified viral miRNA targets within host non-coding RNA loci from AGO interacting regions in three different virus infected cells. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the genes comprising the ceRNA networks in the virus infected cells revealed enrichment of key cellular signalling pathways related to cell fate decisions  and gene transcription, like Notch and Wnt signalling pathways, as well as pathways related to viral entry, replication and virulence. We identified a vast number of non-coding transcripts playing as potential ceRNAs to the immune response associated genes; e.g. APOBEC family genes, in some virus infected cells.

Methods: Exosomes were isolated from ADSCs (ADSC-EXOs) or from ADSCs in which corin gene expression was silenced by siRNA (siCorin). For in\u00a0vivo studies, rats with streptozotocin-induced DM were intravenously injected with ADSC-EXOs or siCorin-ADSC-EXOs. Two weeks later, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured to assess erectile function, and penile tissues were harvested for further evaluation of levels of inflammatory factors and expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). We also evaluated the recovery of neurovascular function in penile tissues by immunofluorescence analysis. Results: The results showed that ADSC-EXOs restored erectile function in diabetic rats, as determined by the ICP/MAP ratio. Exosomes from ADSCs also promoted neurovascular function and suppressed expression of inflammatory factors. In contrast, the decreased content of corin in exosomes after silencing corin in ADSCs reduced the therapeutic effect of exosomes on ED.

In contrast, plant trichomes, known for their production of a large number of metabolites, are a yet unexplored habitat for microbes. We analyzed the phyllosphere as well as trichomes of two tomato genotypes (Solanum lycopersicum LA4024, S. habrochaites LA1777) by targeting bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments. Results Leaves, leaves without trichomes, and trichomes alone harbored similar abundances of bacteria (108\u2013109 16S rRNA gene copy numbers per gram of sample). In contrast, bacterial diversity was found significantly increased in trichome samples (Shannon index: 4.4 vs. 2.5). Moreover, the community composition was significantly different when assessed with beta diversity analysis and corresponding statistical tests. At the bacterial class level, Alphaproteobacteria (23.6%) were significantly increased, whereas Bacilli (8.6%) were decreased in trichomes. The bacterial family Sphingomonadacea (8.4%) was identified as the most prominent, trichome-specific feature; Burkholderiaceae and Actinobacteriaceae showed similar patterns. Moreover, Sphingomonas was identified as a central element in the core microbiome of trichome samples, while distinct low-abundant bacterial families including Hymenobacteraceae and Alicyclobacillaceae were exclusively found in trichome samples. Niche preferences were statistically significant for both genotypes and genotype-specific enrichments were further observed.

Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been studied as a potential therapeutic approach and appears to exert a beneficial effect against neurodegeneration via different mechanisms, such as the production of neurotrophic factors, decreased neuroinflammation, enhanced neuronal plasticity and cell replacement. Thus, NSC transplantation may represent an effective therapeutic strategy. To exploit NSCs\u2019 potential, some of their essential biological characteristics must be thoroughly investigated, including the specific markers for NSC subpopulations, to allow profiling and selection. Another key feature is their secretome, which is responsible for the regulation of intercellular communication, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation. In addition, NSCs must properly migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and integrate into host neuronal circuits, enhancing neuroplasticity. Understanding and modulating these aspects can allow us to further exploit the therapeutic potential of NSCs.

This is attested by the ever\u2010growing reference to the conservation of evolutionary potential in the scientific literature. The impression that one may have when reading papers is that conserving evolutionary potential can only be a good thing, whatever biological system is under scrutiny. However, different objectives, such as maintaining species richness versus ecosystem services, may express different, when not conflicting, underlying values attributed to biodiversity. For instance, biodiversity can be intrinsically valued, as worth it to be conserved per se, or it can be conserved as a means for human flourishing. Consequently, both the concept of evolutionary potential and the prescriptions derived from the commitment to conserve it remain problematic, due to a lack of explicit mention of the norms underlying different conservation visions. Here, we contend that those who advocate for the conservation of evolutionary potential should position their conception along four dimensions: what vehicles instantiate the evolutionary potential relevant to their normative commitment; what temporality is involved; how measurable evolutionary potential is, and what degree of human influence is tolerated. We need to address these dimensions if we are to determine why and when the maintenance of evolutionary potential is an appropriate target for the conservation of biodiversity.", "datePublished": "2020-07-14T15:36:51Z", "url": ["https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12995"], "eissn": "1752-4571", "doi": "10.1111/eva.12995", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Double-Probe Ultrasonic Detection Method for Cracks in Steel Structure", "author": ["Xin Chen", "Zhi Ye", "Jun  Yuan Xia", "Jie  Xiu Wang", "Bo  Hai Ji"], "description": "To investigate the feasibility analysis of ultrasonic detection methods applied in the fatigue crack characteristics of steel structures, the double-probe ultrasonic detection method was applied to the prefabricated crack specimens fabricated from of flat steel plate.

In this study, to infer such epigenetic changes during human hematopoiesis, ancestral state estimation based on a phylogenetic tree was applied to map the epigenomic changes in six kinds of histone modifications onto the hierarchical cell differentiation process of hematopoiesis using epigenomes of eight types of differentiated hematopoietic cells. The histone modification changes inferred during hematopoiesis showed that changes that occurred on the branches separating different cell types reflected the characteristics of hematopoiesis in terms of genomic position and gene function. These results suggested that ancestral state estimation based on phylogenetic analysis of histone modifications in differentiated hematopoietic cells could reconstruct an appropriate landscape of histone modification changes during hematopoiesis. Since integration of the inferred changes of different histone modifications could reveal genes with specific histone marks such as active histone marks and bivalent histone marks on each internal branch of cell-type trees, this approach could provide valuable information for understanding the cell differentiation steps of each cell lineage.", "datePublished": "2020-05-18T05:01:33Z", "url": ["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259015831930018X"], "pissn": "2590-1583", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gene.2019.100021", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Incorporating genetic selection into individual\u2010based models of malaria and other infectious diseases", "author": ["Ian M.

Genetic selection can be incorporated into the IBMs to track the spread of mutations whose origin and spread are driven by the intervention and which subsequently undermine the control strategy; typical examples are mutations which encode drug resistance or diagnosis\u2010 or vaccine\u2010escape phenotypes. Methods and results We simulated the spread of malaria drug resistance using the IBM OpenMalaria to investigate how the finite sizes of IBMs require strategies to optimally incorporate genetic selection. We make four recommendations. Firstly, calculate and report the selection coefficients, s, of the advantageous allele as the key genetic parameter. Secondly, use these values of \u201cs\u201d to calculate the wait time until a mutation successfully establishes itself in the pathogen population. Thirdly, identify the inherent limits of the IBM to robustly estimate small selection coefficients. Fourthly, optimize computational efficacy: when \u201cs\u201d is small, fewer replicates of larger IBMs may be more efficient than a larger number of replicates of smaller size.

However, glioblastoma cells frequently show primary and acquired resistance to TMZ. As a promising anti-GBM candidate, resveratrol (Res) faces the similar problem as TMZ. Although resveratrol combined with TMZ (Res/TMZ) has been reported to be used to treat GBMs, it remains unclear whether this combination is broad-spectrum for all glioma cells until now, especially for GBM cells/cases with dual drug resistance. The study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of resveratrol and TMZ against GBMs and identify the underlying mechanisms.Materials and Methods: Drug sensitivities of rat RG-2, human LN-18 and LN-428 cell lines and effectiveness of Res/TMZ combinations were investigated via multiple experimental methods. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was observed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (ICC). Transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway and expression changes of STAT3-related gene were detected to explore the possible synergistic mechanism.Results: One hundred micromolar resveratrol and 500 &mu;M TMZ inhibited the growth of RG-2 cells and the low-dose combination (25 &mu;M/250 &mu;M) showed similar suppressive effects. LN-18 and, especially, LN-428 cells were neither sensitive to 100 &mu;M resveratrol nor to 500 &mu;M TMZ, while their growth was suppressed by combination of 75 &mu;M Res/750 &mu;M TMZ with the suppressive rates of 62.5% and 28.6% and apoptosis rates of 11.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Resveratrol had regulatory effect on the expression of MGMT and it could significantly down-regulate MGMT overexpression caused by TMZ. In addition, STAT3/Bcl-2/survivin signaling pathway was also remarkably inhibited in Res/TMZ-treated GBM cells.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated synergistic effects of Res/TMZ on RG-2 cells and their bilaterally sensitizing effects to LN-18 and LN-428 cells. Frequent upregulation of MGMT and activation of STAT3 are the unfavorable factors for the treatment of GBMs and they may be the potential targets of Res/TMZ therapy.Keywords: resveratrol, temozolomide, synergistic effects, glioblastoma, MGMT, STAT3, Bcl-2, survivin", "datePublished": "2020-09-13T21:06:09Z", "url": ["https://www.dovepress.com/synergistic-effects-of-resveratrol-and-temozolomide-against-glioblasto-peer-reviewed-article-CMAR"], "pissn": "1179-1322", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Effects of timber harvest on structural diversity and species composition in hardwood forests", "author": ["FARZAM TAVANKAR", "AMIR ESLAM BONYAD"], "description": "Tavankar F, Bonyad AE. 2015.

Over-representation analysis of KEGG pathways associated with these DE genes mapped revealed two most significantly associated biological processes in macular RPE/choroid in AMD, namely the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway (represented by 30 DE genes) and the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction signaling pathway (represented by 12 DE genes).

These promoters combine the action of a general regulatory factor with that of specific transcription factors, a common motif of many eukaryotic promoters. By comprehensively analyzing stationary and dynamic promoter properties, this model-based approach enables us to pinpoint the structural characteristics underlying the observed behavior. Functional tradeoffs impose constraints on the promoter architecture of ribosomal protein genes.

However, the relationships between microbial dynamics, age-related changes in intestinal physiology, and organismal health remain poorly understood. Here, we show that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by an expansion of the Gammaproteobacteria, is tightly linked to age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction in Drosophila. Indeed, alterations in the microbiota precede and predict the onset of intestinal barrier dysfunction in aged flies. Changes in microbial composition occurring prior to intestinal barrier dysfunction contribute to changes in excretory function and immune gene activation in the aging intestine. In addition, we show that a distinct shift in microbiota composition follows intestinal barrier dysfunction, leading to systemic immune activation and organismal death.

Especially self-excited oscillations of higher-order modes lead to critical dynamic loads. The slim drill string design and the naturally limited drilled borehole diameter limit the installation space, power supply and lead to numerous potentially critical self-excited torsional modes. Consequently, small and robust passive damping concepts are required. The variety of possible downhole boundary conditions and potential damper designs necessitates analytical solutions for effective damper design and optimization. In this paper, two nonlinear passive damper concepts are investigated regarding design and effectiveness to reduce self-excited high-frequency torsional oscillations in drill string dynamics. Based on a finite element model of a drill string, a suitable minimal model based on the identified critical mode is generated and solved analytically using the Multiple Scales Lindstedt-Poincar\u00e9 (MSLP) method. The advantages of MSLP compared to conventional MS methods are shown for this example. On the basis of the analytical solution, parameter influences are determined, and design equations are derived.

During iCM reprogramming, the starting fibroblasts must overcome existing epigenetic barriers to acquire the CM-like chromatin pattern. However, epigenetic dynamics along this reprogramming process have not been studied. Here, we took advantage of our recently generated polycistronic system and determined the dynamics of two critical histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in parallel with gene expression at a set of carefully selected cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming. We observed reduced H3K27me3 and increased H3K4me3 at cardiac promoters as early as day 3, paralleled by a rapid significant increase in their mRNA expression. In contrast, H3K27me3 at loci encoding fibroblast marker genes did not increase until day 10 and H3K4me3 progressively decreased along the reprogramming process; these changes were accompanied by a gradual decrease in the mRNA expression of fibroblast marker genes. Further analyses of fibroblast-enriched transcription factors revealed a similarly late deposition of H3K27me3 and decreased mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1 and Twist2, three important players in epithelial\u2212mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest early rapid activation of the cardiac program and later progressive suppression of fibroblast fate at both epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Additionally, we determined the DNA methylation states of representative cardiac promoters and found that not every single CpG was equally demethylated during early stages of iCM reprogramming. Rather, there are specific CpGs, whose demethylation states correlated tightly with transcription activation, that we propose are the major contributing CpGs. Our work thus reveals a differential re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 at cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming and could provide future genome-wide epigenetic studies with important guidance such as the appropriate time window and loci to be utilized as positive and negative controls.", "datePublished": "2016-04-27T13:01:52Z", "url": ["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506116000799"], "pissn": "1873-5061", "eissn": "1876-7753", "doi": "10.1016/j.scr.2016.02.037", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "PD-L1 expression associated with better response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors", "author": ["Rafael Rosell", "Ram&#243;n Palmero"], "datePublished": "2019-07-03T09:43:12Z", "url": ["http://www.cancerbiomed.org/index.php/cocr/article/view/842"], "pissn": "2095-3941", "eissn": "2095-3941", "doi": "10.7497/j.issn.2095-3941.2015.0026", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Pufferfish Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin Binding Protein (PSTBP) Analogues in the Blood Plasma of the Pufferfish Arothron nigropunctatus, A. hispidus, A. manilensis, and Chelonodon patoca", "author": ["Mari Yotsu-Yamashita", "Yuuma Nagaoka", "Koji Muramoto", "Yuko Cho", "Keiichi Konoki"], "description": "Pufferfish saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin (TTX) binding protein (PSTBP) is a glycoprotein that we previously isolated from the blood plasma of the pufferfish Takifugu pardalis; this protein was also detected in seven species of the genus Takifugu.

We have previously shown that farming mothers consume more full-fat dairy than control mothers, who instead consume more low-fat dairy, margarine, and oils; margarine and oil intake was associated with increased risk of allergy development in their children. Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in diet between children in farming and control families at 1 year of age, to investigate the relation between the diets of the mothers and their children, and to relate the children's diet to allergy development. Design: The diet of 1-year-old children from dairy farming families (n=28) and from control families in the same rural area (n=37) was assessed by 24-h dietary recalls, followed by 24-h food diaries. Allergy was diagnosed by pediatricians at 3 years of age using strict predefined criteria. Results: Farm children had a higher intake of farm milk, whole cream, cholesterol, saturated fat, and fat in total and tended to eat more butter, while controls consumed more carbohydrates and poultry and tended to eat more margarine. Farm children also had higher intakes of homemade porridge/gruel, oily fish, and iodine. The intake of butter and whole milk in children and mothers correlated significantly in farm families but not in controls. A weak negative association was found between seafood intake and allergy development, while allergy was positively associated with the intake of pork as well as zinc in the control group; these intakes also correlated with each other. Conclusions: Consistent with mothers in farming families, the children consumed more full-fat dairy and saturated fat than did controls, but this could not be linked to the low risk of allergy in the farming group.

To improve the quality of the fiber-based products in the future, a thorough understanding of the main cell wall polymer biosynthetic pathways is required. In this study we have carried out a characterization of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis in flax along with some of their regulation mechanisms. Results We have first identified the members of the phenylpropanoid gene families through a combination of in silico approaches. The more specific lignin genes were further characterized by high throughput transcriptomic approaches in different organs and physiological conditions and their cell/tissue expression was localized in the stems, roots and leaves. Laccases play an important role in the polymerization of monolignols. This multigenic family was determined and a miRNA was identified to play a role in the posttranscriptional regulation by cleaving the transcripts of some specific genes shown to be expressed in lignified tissues. In situ hybridization also showed that the miRNA precursor was expressed in the young xylem cells located near the vascular cambium. The results obtained in this work also allowed us to determine that most of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis are included in a unique co-expression cluster and that MYB transcription factors are potentially good candidates for regulating these genes. Conclusions Target engineering of cell walls to improve plant product quality requires good knowledge of the genes responsible for the production of the main polymers. For bast fiber plants such as flax, it is important to target the correct genes from the beginning since the difficulty to produce transgenic material does not make possible to test a large number of genes. Our work determined which of these genes could be potentially modified and showed that it was possible to target different regulatory pathways to modify lignification.", "datePublished": "2018-08-14T14:31:44Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12870-017-1072-9"], "doi": "10.1186/s12870-017-1072-9", "eissn": "1471-2229", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Evaluaci\u00f3n de tres productos biol\u00f3gicos en el control del Moho Gris (Botrytis Cinerea) de la fresa en el municipio de Sibat\u00e9 Cundinamarca", "author": ["Liliana Estupi\u00f1an L.", "Omar Guerrero G."], "description": "La presente investigaci\u00f3n tuvo como objeto evaluar tres productos biol\u00f3gicos: Mycobac, Virobat, Starzyme y un producto qu\u00edmico (Orthocide), en el control de moho gris (Botrytis cinerea), respecto al rendimiento y calidad de fruto en el cultivo de fresa (Fragaria chiloensis L).

Melatonin (MLT) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have properties to modulate both, but their protective role, mainly at early stages of prostate cancer, remains unclear. In this study, the effects of MLT and DHA, combined or not, on PNT1A cells with regard to mitochondria bioenergetics, ROS production, and proliferation-related pathways were examined. Based on dose response and lipid accumulation assays, DHA at 100\u2009\u03bcM and MLT at 1\u2009\u03bcM for 48\u2009h were chosen. DHA doubled and MLT reduced (40%) superoxide anion production, but coincubation (DM) did not normalize to control. Hydrogen peroxide production decreased after MLT incubation only (p<0.01). These alterations affected the area and perimeter of mitochondria, since DHA increased whereas MLT decreased, but such hormone has no effect on coincubation. DHA isolated did not change the oxidative phosphorylation rate (OXPHOS), but decreased (p<0.001) the mitochondrial bioenergetic reserve capacity (MBRC) which is closely related to cell responsiveness to stress conditions. MLT, regardless of DHA, ameliorated OXPHOS and recovered MBRC after coincubation. All incubations decreased AKT phosphorylation; however, only MLT alone inhibited p-mTOR. MLT increased p-ERK1/2 and, when combined to DHA, increased GSTP1 expression (p<0.01). DHA did not change the testosterone levels in the medium, whereas MLT alone or coincubated decreased by about 20%; however, any incubation affected AR expression. Moreover, incubation with luzindole revealed that MLT effects were MTR1/2-independent. In conclusion, DHA increased ROS production and impaired mitochondrial function which was probably related to AKT inactivation; MLT improved OXPHOS and decreased ROS which was related to AKT/mTOR dephosphorylation, and when coincubated, the antiproliferative action was related to mitochondrial bioenergetic modulation associated to AKT and ERK1/2 regulation.

In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers\u2019 poultry house, were collected on days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch. The different sample types were evaluated on their applicability and reliability to characterize the broiler intestinal microbiota. The microbiota of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of \u03b1 and \u03b2 measures showed a similar development of microbiota composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch.

The production mechanism of the secondary polyphenols in black tea, whisky, cinnamon, and persimmon fruits will be introduced. In the process of black tea production, tea leaf catechins are enzymatically oxidized to yield a complex mixture of oxidation products, including theaflavins and thearubigins. Despite the importance of the beverage, most of the chemical constituents have not yet been confirmed due to the complexity of the mixture. However, the reaction mechanisms at the initial stages of catechin oxidation are explained by simple quinone\u2013phenol coupling reactions. In vitro model experiments indicated the presence of interesting regio- and stereoselective reactions. Recent results on the reaction mechanisms will be introduced. During the aging of whisky in oak wood barrels, ellagitannins originating from oak wood are oxidized and react with ethanol to give characteristic secondary ellagitannins. The major part of the cinnamon procyanidins is polymerized by copolymerization with cinnamaldehyde. In addition, anthocyanidin structural units are generated in the polymer molecules by oxidation which accounts for the reddish coloration of the cinnamon extract. This reaction is related to the insolubilization of proanthocyanidins in persimmon fruits by condensation with acetaldehyde. In addition to oxidation, the reaction of polyphenols with aldehydes may be important in food processing.

A chief contributor to this barrier is the impact on microbial processes and energy metabolism of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, including phenolic carboxylates, phenolic amides (for ammonia-pretreated biomass), phenolic aldehydes, and furfurals. To understand the bacterial pathways induced by inhibitors present in ammonia-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, which are less well studied than acid-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, we developed and exploited synthetic mimics of ammonia-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH). To determine regulatory responses to the inhibitors normally present in ACSH, we measured transcript and protein levels in an Escherichia coli ethanologen using RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics during fermentation to ethanol of synthetic hydrolysates containing or lacking the inhibitors. Our study identified four major regulators mediating these responses, the MarA/SoxS/Rob network, AaeR, FrmR, and YqhC. Induction of these regulons was correlated with a reduced rate of ethanol production, buildup of pyruvate, depletion of ATP and NAD(P)H, and an inhibition of xylose conversion. The aromatic aldehyde inhibitor 5-hydroxymethylfurfural appeared to be reduced to its alcohol form by the ethanologen during fermentation, whereas phenolic acid and amide inhibitors were not metabolized. Together, our findings establish that the major regulatory responses to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors are mediated by transcriptional rather than translational regulators, suggest that energy consumed for inhibitor efflux and detoxification may limit biofuel production, and identify a network of regulators for future synthetic biology efforts.", "datePublished": "2014-09-16T14:36:37Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00402/full"], "eissn": "1664-302X", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2014.00402", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Disentangling the effects of insomnia and night work on                     cardiovascular diseases: a study in nursing professionals", "author": ["A.

West", "Heinz Steiner"], "description": "Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is limited by the emergence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Such dyskinesia is associated with aberrant gene regulation in neurons of the striatum, which is caused by abnormal dopamine release from serotonin terminals. Previous work showed that modulating the striatal serotonin innervation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 5-HT1A receptor agonists could attenuate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We investigated the effects of a novel serotonergic agent, vilazodone, which combines SSRI and 5-HT1A partial agonist properties, on L-DOPA-induced behavior and gene regulation in the striatum in an animal model of Parkinson\u2019s disease. After unilateral dopamine depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), rats received repeated L-DOPA treatment (5 mg/kg) alone or in combination with vilazodone (10 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. Gene regulation was then mapped throughout the striatum using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Vilazodone suppressed the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and turning behavior but did not interfere with the prokinetic effects of L-DOPA (forelimb stepping). L-DOPA treatment drastically increased the expression of dynorphin (direct pathway), 5-HT1B, and zif268 mRNA in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion. These effects were inhibited by vilazodone. In contrast, vilazodone had no effect on enkephalin expression (indirect pathway) or on gene expression in the intact striatum. Thus, vilazodone inhibited L-DOPA-induced gene regulation selectively in the direct pathway of the dopamine-depleted striatum, molecular changes that are considered critical for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. These findings position vilazodone, an approved antidepressant, as a potential adjunct medication for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced motor side effects.", "datePublished": "2020-10-10T00:02:06Z", "url": ["https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/10/2265"], "doi": "10.3390/cells9102265", "eissn": "2073-4409", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Correcting palindromes in long reads after whole-genome amplification", "author": ["Sven Warris", "Elio Schijlen", "Henri van de Geest", "Rahulsimham Vegesna", "Thamara Hesselink", "Bas te Lintel Hekkert", "Gabino Sanchez Perez", "Paul Medvedev", "Kateryna D.

Our study showed that the seamount population in the OSPAR area (north-east Atlantic) and in the Mediterranean Sea is large with around 557 and 101 seamount-like features, respectively. Similarly, seamounts occupy large areas of about 616 000 km<sup>2</sup> in the OSPAR region and of about 89 500 km<sup>2</sup> in the Mediterranean Sea. The presence of seamounts in the north-east Atlantic has been known since the late 19th century, but overall knowledge regarding seamount ecology and geology is still relatively poor. Only 37 seamounts in the OSPAR area (3.5% of all seamounts in the region), 22 in the Mediterranean Sea (9.2% of all seamounts in the region) and 25 in the north-east Atlantic south of the OSPAR area have in situ information. Seamounts mapped in both areas are in general very heterogeneous, showing diverse geophysical characteristics.

MdFRK2 promoter transiently expressed in tobacco leaves further supported that the expression of MdFRK2 could be inhibited by exogenous melatonin. After applying exogenous melatonin, the suppression of MdFRK2 expression was significantly rescued in transgenic apples overexpressing MdFRK2 via the 35S promoter. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose concentrations increased less as compared to WT apple plants. Wild-type plants showed a stunted phenotype 21 days after melatonin treatment, while MdFRK2-overexpressing plants exhibited slightly inhibited growth, indicating that the downregulated MdFRK2 expression in response to melatonin was involved in melatonin-mediated growth inhibition.

It does separation on the mixtures using CERBM which results in two output sources, i.e. clutter and target. Finally, the target is detected using estimation of the parameters of K-distribution for outputted sources. Our experiments on the recognized IPIX radar database show that the proposed detector obtains better detection performance in comparison to the newly proposed detectors.

We developed a prosthetic hand for amputees with a thumb and metacarpal. In this case of amputation, the installation of actuators and electrical components is difficult because space is considerably limited owing to the residual metacarpal. This design issue is solved by installing actuators vertically between finger modules and the mounting part where the electrical parts are embedded. With this design, the arrangement between the palm of the patient and the fingers of the prosthetic hand can be adjusted as well. Weight is also an especially important design issue in the development of a practical prosthetic hand because the patient perceives that weight. Most prosthetic hands are attached to the residual limb of the amputee by compressing the contact surface between the product and the amputated body part of the patient. Heavy weight causes users to feel discomfort and fatigue over extended periods of usage. In this study, all frames used in the proposed prosthetic hand were fabricated from nylon using multi-jet-fusion three-dimensional printing. As a result, the weight of the developed prosthetic hand was only 152.32 g but still had the desired strength and stiffness. Each prosthetic finger has four-degree-of-freedom.

Traditional method to limit DC fault current is to use superconducting technology or power electronic devices, which is quite difficult to be brought to practical use under high voltage circumstances. In this paper, a novel concept of high voltage DC transmission system fault current limiter (DCSFCL) based on saturable core was proposed. In the DCSFCL, the permanent magnets (PM) are added on both up and down side of the core to generate reverse magnetic flux that offset the magnetic flux generated by DC current and make the DC winding present a variable inductance to the DC system. In normal state, DCSFCL works as a smoothing reactor and its inductance is within the scope of the design requirements. When a fault occurs, the inductance of DCSFCL rises immediately and limits the steepness of the fault current. Magnetic field simulations were carried out, showing that compared with conventional smoothing reactor, DCSFCL can decrease the high steepness of DC fault current by 17% in less than 10ms, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.", "datePublished": "2018-06-01T17:35:17Z", "url": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5006531"], "pissn": "2158-3226", "doi": "10.1063/1.5006531", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "The influence of catch trials on the consolidation of motor memory in force field adaptation tasks", "author": ["Anne eFocke", "Christian eStockinger", "Christina eDiepold", "Marco eTaubert", "Thorsten eStein"], "description": "In computational neuroscience it is generally accepted that human motor memory contains neural representations of the physics of the musculoskeletal system and the objects in the environment.

Force field studies, in which subjects have to adapt to dynamic perturbations induced by a robotic manipulandum, are an established tool to analyze the characteristics of such internal models. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether catch trials during force field learning could influence the consolidation of motor memory in more complex tasks. Thereby, the force field was more than double the force field of previous studies (35 Ns/m). Moreover, the arm of the subjects was not supported. A total of forty-six subjects participated in this study and performed center-out movements at a robotic manipulandum in two different force fields. Two control groups learned force field A on day 1 and were retested in the same force field on day 3 (AA). Two test groups additionally learned an interfering force field B (=-A) on day 2 (ABA). The difference between the two test and control groups, respectively, was the absence (0%) or presence (19%) of catch trials, in which the force field was turned off suddenly. The results showed consolidation of force field A on day 3 for both control groups. Test groups showed no consolidation of force field A (19% catch trials) and even poorer performance on day 3 (0% catch trials). In conclusion, it can be stated that catch trials seem to have a positive effect on the performance on day 3 but do not trigger a consolidation process as shown in previous studies that used a lower force field viscosity with supported arm. These findings indicate that the results of previous studies in which less complex tasks were analyzed, cannot be fully transferred to more complex tasks.

Neuroinflammation and TDP-43 pathology are prominent features in CTE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic variation in TMEM106B is associated with CTE risk, pathological features, and ante-mortem dementia. Eighty-six deceased male athletes with a history of participation in American football, informant-reported Caucasian, and a positive postmortem diagnosis of CTE without comorbid neurodegenerative disease were genotyped for rs3173615. The minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009=\u20090.42) in participants with CTE did not differ from previously reported neurologically normal controls (MAF\u2009=\u20090.43). However, in a case-only analysis among CTE cases, the minor allele was associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) (AT8 density, odds ratio [OR] of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22\u20130.79, p\u2009=\u20090.008), reduced neuroinflammation in the DLFC (CD68 density, OR of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.53, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.98, p\u2009=\u20090.043), and increased synaptic protein density (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.306, 95% CI 0.065\u20130.546, p\u2009=\u20090.014).

While considerable research has focused on ORN responses to odorants, the mechanisms by which olfactory information is encoded in the activities of ORNs and translated into navigational behavior remain poorly understood. We sought to determine the contributions of most Drosophila melanogaster larval ORNs to navigational behavior. Using odorants to activate ORNs and a larval tracking assay to measure the corresponding behavioral response, we observed that larval ORN activators cluster into four groups based on the behavior responses elicited from larvae. This is significant because it provides new insights into the functional relationship between ORN activity and behavioral response. Subsequent optogenetic analyses of a subset of ORNs revealed previously undescribed properties of larval ORNs. Furthermore, our results indicated that different temporal patterns of ORN activation elicit different behavioral outputs: some ORNs respond to stimulus increments while others respond to stimulus decrements. These results suggest that the ability of ORNs to encode temporal patterns of stimulation increases the coding capacity of the olfactory circuit. Moreover, the ability of ORNs to sense stimulus increments and decrements facilitates instantaneous evaluations of concentration changes in the environment. Together, these ORN properties enable larvae to efficiently navigate a complex olfactory environment. Ultimately, knowledge of how ORN activity patterns and their weighted contributions influence odor coding may eventually reveal how peripheral information is organized and transmitted to subsequent layers of a neural circuit.", "datePublished": "2018-12-21T04:49:01Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00324/full"], "eissn": "1662-5153", "doi": "10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00324", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Perceived Intensity and Discrimination Ability for Lingual Electrotactile Stimulation Depends on Location and Orientation of Electrodes", "author": ["Leslie M.

One solution, called sensory substitution, is to use another sensory system to bring lost information to the brain. This approach often involves the use of bioengineered devices that electrically stimulate somatosensory fibers. Interestingly, the tongue is an ideal location for electrotactile stimulation due to its dense innervation, moisture, and protected environment. Success with transmitting visual and vestibular information through the tongue indicates promise for future applications. However, sensitivity and discrimination ability varies between individuals and across the tongue surface complicating efforts to produce reliable and consistent sensations. The goals of the present study were to investigate these differences more precisely to better understand the mechanosensory innervation of the tongue so that future electrotactile devices can be designed more effectively. Specifically, we tested whether stimulation of certain regions of the tongue consistently result in better perception, whether the spacing of stimulating electrodes affects perceived intensity, and whether the orientation of electrodes affects perceived intensity and discrimination. To test these hypotheses, we built a custom tongue stimulation device, recruited 25 participants, and collected perceived intensity and discrimination data. We then subjected the data to thorough statistical analyses. Consistent with previous studies, we found that stimulation of the anterior medial tongue region was perceived as more intense than stimulation of lateral and posterior regions. This region also had the best discrimination ability for electrodes. Dividing the stimulated tongue area into 16 distinct regions allowed us to compare perception ability between anterior and posterior regions, medial and lateral regions, and the left and right sides of the tongue. Stimulation of the most anterior and medial tongue resulted in the highest perceived intensity and the best discrimination ability. Most individuals were able to perceive and discriminate electrotactile stimulation better on one side of the tongue, and orientation of stimulating electrodes affected perception.

Eighteen S-REs, 17 US-REs and 17 UREs were asked to perform a Go/No-Go task after being shown pictures of either high-caloric or low-caloric food.Results: fMRI results revealed stronger activations for high-caloric food in areas associated with executive function and inhibition (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum) among S-REs than among US-REs. In contrast, both US-REs and UREs showed stronger activations for low-caloric food in reward areas (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) than S-REs.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that food temptations may trigger processes of successful inhibition control in S-REs, whereas US-REs may fail in resisting the attraction to high-caloric food, thereby showing a high probability of overeating.Keywords: successful and unsuccessful restrained eaters, measurement of restrained eating, inhibition control, fMRI", "datePublished": "2019-12-19T18:45:13Z", "url": ["https://www.dovepress.com/why-do-most-restrained-eaters-fail-in-losing-weight-evidence-from-an-f-peer-reviewed-article-PRBM"], "pissn": "1179-1578", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Friends with Social Benefits: Host-Microbe Interactions as a Driver of Brain Evolution and Development?", "author": ["Roman M Stilling", "Roman M Stilling", "Seth R Bordenstein", "Timothy G Dinan", "Timothy G Dinan", "John F Cryan", "John F Cryan"], "description": "The tight association of the human body with trillions of colonizing microbes that we observe today is the result of a long evolutionary history.

More than 2 billion people have been exposed to HBV, and about 257 million individuals are chronic carriers of HBV. HBV reactivation has been increasingly reported in HBV carriers who have undergone immunosuppression or chemotherapy, resulting in mortality. Treatment of hypothalamic/pituitary tumors in HBV carriers requires extensive care to avoid HBV reactivation as steroid therapy is required after surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors. Case presentation This retrospective review identified 5 patients, who were HBV carriers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen among 1352 patients with surgically treated hypothalamic/pituitary tumor in Kohnan Hospital between February 2007 and April 2017. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed with particular attention to prevent damage to the pituitary gland, with delicate manipulation to minimize postoperative steroid coverage. All patients received nucleot(s)ide analogue to control HBV-DNA levels before the surgery. As a result, all patients had a good clinical course. Blood examinations found a transient increase of liver enzymes and HBV-DNA levels in all patients, which started to decrease within 2\u2009weeks after surgery. No specific treatment other than nucleot(s)ide analogues was needed to maintain liver function, and all patients returned to their previous activities including reinstatement. Conclusion Initiation of nucleot(s)ide analogues administration prior to the surgery for hypothalamic/pituitary tumors can be an effective strategy for preventing reactivation in HBV carriers. Appropriate screening of the patient\u2019s HBV phase, optimal timing of nucleot(s)ide analogues -administration, and administration period of nucleot(s)ide analogues need to be established.", "datePublished": "2020-03-20T17:54:21Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12879-020-04971-2"], "doi": "10.1186/s12879-020-04971-2", "eissn": "1471-2334", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Increased Postural Demand Is Associated With Greater Cognitive Workload in Healthy Young Adults: A Pupillometry Study", "author": ["Melike Kahya", "Tyler A.

Pupillometry has been used to quantify cognitive workload of various cognitive tasks, but has not been studied in postural control. The current investigation utilized pupillometry to quantify the cognitive workload of postural control in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that cognitive workload, indexed by pupil size, will increase with challenging postural control conditions including visual occlusion and cognitive dual tasking.Methods: Twenty-one young healthy adults (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean), (age = 23.2 \u00b1 0.49 years; 12 females) were recruited for this study. Participants completed four tasks: (1) standing with eyes open; (2) standing with eyes occluded (3) standing with eyes open while performing an auditory Stroop task; and (4) standing with eyes occluded while performing an auditory Stroop task. Participants wore eye tracking glasses while standing on a force platform. The eye tracking glasses recorded changes in pupil size that in turn were converted into the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA). ICA values were averaged for each eye and condition. A two-way Analysis of Variance with post-hoc Sidak correction for pairwise comparisons was run to examine the effect of visual occlusion and dual tasking on ICA values as well on Center of Pressure (CoP) sway velocity in anterior\u2013posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions. A Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was utilized to determine the relationship between ICA values and CoP sway velocity.Results: Significant within-condition effect was observed with visual occlusion for the right eye ICA values (p = 0.008). Right eye ICA increased from eyes open to eyes occluded conditions (p = 0.008). In addition, a significant inverse correlation was observed between right eye ICA values and CoP sway velocity in the ML direction across all the conditions (r = -0.25, p = 0.02).Conclusion: This study demonstrated support for increased cognitive workload, measured by pupillometry, as a result of changes in postural control in healthy young adults.

Methods One hundred children and adolescents with Migraine without Aura were compared with a control group of 100 children without headache. The Security Scale (measures perceived security of attachments) and the Self-Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents, a measure of anxiety symptoms, were administered to all participants. Results The clinical group had lower attachment security than the control group and higher scores on all anxiety scales. Anxiety was negatively correlated with attachment. Children\u2019s attachment to their mother mediated the increase in global anxiety in the clinical group. Insecure paternal attachment was associated with greater insecurity in maternal attachment, suggesting that there is a complex pathway from migraine to anxiety symptoms mediated by perceived insecurity of paternal attachment and hence also by perceived insecurity of maternal attachment.

We used a microfluidic chamber driven with a high-speed pressure servo to generate defined fluid shear stress to cultured astrocytes, and simultaneously measured cytoskeletal forces using a force sensitive actinin optical sensor and intracellular Ca2+. Fluid shear generated non-uniform forces in actinin that critically depended on the stimulus rise time emphasizing the presence of viscoelasticity in the activating sequence. A short (ms) shear pulse with fast rise time (2 ms) produced an immediate increase in actinin tension at the upstream end of the cell with minimal changes at the downstream end. The onset of Ca2+ rise began at highly strained areas. In contrast to stimulus steps, slow ramp stimuli produced uniform forces throughout the cells and only a small Ca2+ response. The heterogeneity of force distribution is exaggerated in cells having fewer stress fibers and lower pre-tension in actinin. Disruption of cytoskeleton with cytochalasin-D (Cyt-D) eliminated force gradients, and in those cells Ca2+ elevation started from the soma.

The identification of addiction resilience factors is a potential strategy to identify new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear sulfated polysaccharide that is a component of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate modulates the activity and distribution of a set of negatively charged signaling peptides and proteins \u2014 known as the HS interactome \u2014 by acting as a co-receptor or alternative receptor for growth factors and other signaling peptides and sequestering and localizing them, among other actions.

The ability of the HS-binding neuropeptide glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to increase cocaine intake was potentiated by a deletion that abolished its HS binding. The delivery of heparanase, the endo-\u03b2-D-glucuronidase that degrades HS, accelerated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and promoted persistent responding during extinction.

We aimed to evaluate the trajectory of brain growth in a cohort of patients with complex CHD (n\u202f=\u202f16) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f15) to test the hypothesis that patients with complex CHD would have smaller total brain volume (TBV) prenatally, which would become increasingly prominent by three months of age. Participants underwent fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a mean of 32\u202fweeks gestation, a preoperative/neonatal MRI shortly after birth, a postoperative MRI (CHD only), and a 3-month MRI to evaluate the trajectory of brain growth. Three-dimensional volumetric analysis was applied to the MRI data to measure TBV, as well as tissue-specific volumes of the cortical gray matter (CGM), white matter (WM), subcortical (deep nuclear) gray matter (SCGM), cerebellum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A random coefficients model was used to investigate longitudinal changes in TBV and demonstrated an altered trajectory of brain growth in the CHD population. The estimated slope for TBV from fetal to 3-month MRI was 11.5\u202fcm3 per week for CHD infants compared to 16.7\u202fcm3 per week for controls (p\u202f=\u202f0.0002).

To date, few studies have used neurophysiological measures in combination to subjective measures to assess cognitive workload during a walking task. This combined approach can provide more insights into the amount of cognitive resources in relation with the perceived mental effort involving in a walking task.Research Question: The objective was to examine cognitive workload in young adults during walking conditions varying in complexity.Methods: Twenty-five young adults (mean = 24.4 \u00b1 5.4) performed four conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) simple DT walking, (3) complex DT walking and (4) standing while subtracting. During the walking task, mean speed, cadence, stride time, stride length, and their respective coefficient of variation (CV) were recorded. Cognitive workload will be measured through changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (\u0394HbO2 and \u0394HbR) during walking in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and perceived mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire.Results: In young adults, \u0394HbO2 in the DLPFC increased from usual walking to both DT walking conditions and standing while subtracting condition. \u0394HbO2 did not differ between the simple and complex DT and between the complex DT and standing while subtracting condition. Perceived mental demand gradually increased with walking task complexity. As expected, all mean values of gait parameters were altered according to task complexity. CV of speed, cadence and stride time were significantly higher during DT walking conditions than during usual walking whereas CV of stride length was only higher during complex DT walking than during usual walking.Significance: Young adults had greater cognitive workload in the two DT walking conditions compared to usual walking. However, only the mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire discriminated simple from complex DT walking. Subjective measure provides complementary information to objective one on changes in cognitive workload during challenging walking tasks in young adults.

One mechanism by which anesthesia may impair cognition is by decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Several studies have seen a reduction in cell survival after anesthesia in rodents with most studies focusing on two particularly vulnerable age windows: the neonatal period and old age. However, the extent to which sedation affects neurogenesis in young adults remains unclear. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) was analyzed in male and female rats 24 h after a 4-h period of sedation with isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or dexmedetomidine. Three different cell populations were quantified: cells that were 1 week or 1 month old, labeled with the permanent birthdate markers EdU or BrdU, respectively, and precursor cells, identified by their expression of the endogenous dividing cell marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at the time of sacrifice. Midazolam and dexmedetomidine reduced cell proliferation in the adult DG in both sexes but had no effect on postmitotic cells. Propofol reduced the number of relatively mature, 28-day old, neurons specifically in female rats and had no effects on younger cells. Isoflurane had no detectable effects on any of the cell populations examined. These findings show no general effect of sedation on adult-born neurons but demonstrate that certain sedatives do have drug-specific and sex-specific effects. The impacts observed on different cell populations predict that any cognitive effects of these sedatives would likely occur at different times, with propofol producing a rapid but short-lived impairment and midazolam and dexmedetomidine altering cognition after a several week delay. Taken together, these studies lend support to the hypothesis that decreased neurogenesis in the young adult DG may mediate the effects of sedation on cognitive function.", "datePublished": "2020-10-22T15:52:09Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.588356/full"], "eissn": "1662-453X", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2020.588356", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Assessment of Human Bio-Behavior During Gait Process Using LifeMOD Software", "author": ["Liliana Rogozea", "Luciana Cristea", "Diana Cotoros", "Mihaela Baritz"], "description": "In this paper we present a set of observations concerning the&lt;br /&gt;analysis and assessment of human bio-behavior during gait process.

We addressed this question by assessing face perception abilities in a group of tone-deaf individuals and matched non-tone-deaf subjects. The Cambridge (CFMT) and the Warrington (WRMT) face memory tests were used to assess face processing in the combined group of 12, out of which six tested in the tone-deaf range. Only tone-deaf participants (two out of six) scored in the impaired range on the CFMT, one of whom was also impaired on the WRMT face memory test. Furthermore, the melodic composite score of all participants on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia significantly correlated with their face recognition score on the CFMT. Our results suggest that in some cases tone-deafness might co-occur with face recognition impairments.

The amazing part is that such a multisensory integration brings all information into a unified percept.

This forms the first part of the present study conducted in a non-human primate\u2019s model (n=2) engaged in a detection sensory-motor task where visual and auditory stimuli were displayed individually or simultaneously. The measured parameters were the reaction time (RT) between stimulus and onset of arm movement, successes and errors percentages, as well as the evolution as a function of time of these parameters with training. As expected, RTs were shorter when the subjects were exposed to combined stimuli. The gains for both subjects were around 20 and 40 msec, as compared with the auditory and visual stimulus alone, respectively. Moreover the number of correct responses increased in response to bimodal stimuli. We interpreted such multisensory advantage through redundant signal effect which decreases perceptual ambiguity, increases speed of stimulus detection and improves performance accuracy.The second part of the study presents single unit recordings derived from the premotor cortex (PM) of the same subjects during the sensory-motor task. Response patterns to sensory/multisensory stimulation are documented and specific type proportions are reported.

In many models, we face an intricate interplay between the topology of the network and the dynamics of the system, which is generally very hard to disentangle. A dynamical feature that has been subject of intense research in various fields are correlations between the noisy activity of nodes in a network. We consider a class of systems, where discrete signals are sent along the links of the network. Such systems are of particular relevance in neuroscience, because they provide models for networks of neurons that use action potentials for communication. We study correlations in dynamic networks with arbitrary topology, assuming linear pulse coupling. With our novel approach, we are able to understand in detail how specific structural motifs affect pairwise correlations. Based on a power series decomposition of the covariance matrix, we describe the conditions under which very indirect interactions will have a pronounced effect on correlations and population dynamics. In random networks, we find that indirect interactions may lead to a broad distribution of activation levels with low average but highly variable correlations. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in networks with distance dependent connectivity. In contrast, networks with highly connected hubs or patchy connections often exhibit strong average correlations.

To generate an optimal behavioral output, the nervous system must process sensory information and generate a directed motor output in response to stimuli. The nervous system should also store information about experiences to use in the future. The diverse group of free-living nematodes provides an excellent system to study macro- and microevolution of molecular, morphological and behavioral character states associated with such nervous system function. We asked whether an adaptive behavior would vary among bacterivorous nematodes and whether differences in the neurotransmitter systems known to regulate the behavior in one species would reflect differences seen in the adaptive behavior among those species. <it>Caenorhabditis elegans </it>worms slow in the presence of food; this 'basal' slowing is triggered by dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons that detect bacteria.

Like many patients with anxiety disorders, individuals with elevated levels of dispositional anxiety are prone to intrusive and distressing thoughts in the absence of immediate threat. Recent electrophysiological research suggests that these symptoms are rooted in the mis-allocation of working memory (WM) resources to threat-related information. Here, functional MRI was used to identify the network of brain regions that support WM for faces and to quantify the allocation of neural resources to threat-related distracters in 81 young adults. Results revealed widespread evidence of mis-allocation. This was evident in both face-selective regions of the fusiform cortex and domain-general regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortices. This bias was exaggerated among individuals with a more anxious disposition. Mediation analyses provided compelling evidence that anxious individuals\u2019 tendency to mis-allocate WM resources to threat-related distracters is statistically explained by heightened amygdala reactivity.

Correct performance was rewarded in 75 % of the trials.  Monkeys were certain that they would be rewarded only in the trials immediately following withheld rewards. In these trials, the animals responded sooner and moved faster. Single-unit recordings from the dorsal striatum revealed that modulations in striatal neurons reflected such modulations of movement vigor. First, in the trials with certain rewards, striatal neurons modulated their firing rates earlier. Second, magnitudes of changes in neuronal firing rates depended on whether or not monkeys were certain about the reward.

Nowadays there are no effective therapies available to treat patients with SMA, so our aim was to test whether the non-toxic carboxy-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (TTC), which exhibits neurotrophic properties, might have a therapeutic role or benefit in SMA. In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that TTC enhance the SMN expression in motor neurons in vitro and evaluated the effect of intramuscular injection of TTC-encoding plasmid in the spinal cord and the skeletal muscle of SMNdelta7 mice. For this purpose, we studied the weight and the survival time, as well as, the survival and cell death pathways and muscular atrophy. Our results showed that TTC treatment reduced the expression of autophagy markers (Becn1, Atg5, Lc3 and p62) and pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and Casp3 in spinal cord. In skeletal muscle, TTC was able to downregulate the expression of the main marker of autophagy, Lc3, to wild type levels and the expression of the apoptosis effector protein, Casp3. Regarding the genes related to muscular atrophy (Ankrd1, Calm1, Col19a1, Fbox32, Mt2, Myod1, NogoA, Pax7, Rrad, and Sln), TTC suggest a compensatory effect for muscle damage response, diminished oxidative stress and modulated calcium homeostasis.

However, DTI is unable to resolve the complicated neural structure, i.e., the fiber crossing that is frequently observed during the maturation process. To overcome this limitation, several methods have been proposed. One such method, generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), can be applied to a variety of datasets, including the single shell, multi-shell or grid sampling schemes that are believed to be able to resolve the complicated crossing fibers. Rabbits have been widely used for neurodevelopment research because they exhibit human-like timing of perinatal brain white matter maturation. Here, we present a longitudinal study using both DTI and GQI to demonstrate the changes in cerebral maturation of in vivo developing rabbit brains over a period of 40 weeks. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI and generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) of GQI indices demonstrated that the white matter anisotropy increased with age, with GFA exhibiting an increase in the hippocampus as well. Normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA) of GQI also revealed an increase in the hippocampus, allowing us to observe the changes in gray matter as well. Regional and whole brain DTI tractography also demonstrated refinement in fiber pathway architecture with maturation.

The aim of the study was to explore the socio-economic status of households with a person with severe mental disorder (SMD; psychosis or bipolar disorder) or depression compared to households without an affected person. Methods A population-based, comparative, cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Sodo district, south Ethiopia, between January and November 2015. Two samples were recruited, each with its own comparison group. Sample (1): households of 290 community-ascertained persons with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of SMD and a comparison group of 289 households without a person with SMD. Sample (2): households of 128 people who attended the primary health care centre and who were identified by primary care staff as having a probable diagnosis of depressive disorder; and comparison households of 129 patients who attended for other reasons and who did not receive a diagnosis of depression. Household socioeconomic status (household income, consumption and asset-based wealth) was assessed using a contextualized version of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) questionnaire. Each disorder group (SMD and depression) was further divided into higher and lower disability groups on the basis of median score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Results Households of a person with SMD who had higher disability were more likely to have a poorer living standard (no toilet facility; p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Having a reliable source of regular income was significantly lower in households of a person with SMD (p\u00a0=\u20090.008) or depression (p\u00a0=\u20090.046) with higher disability than the comparison group. Households of persons with SMD with higher disability earned less (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and owned significantly fewer assets (p\u2009<\u20090.001) than households without SMD. Households including persons with depression who had higher disability had lower income (p\u2009=\u20090.042) and reduced consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Conclusions Households with a member who had either SMD or depression were socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to the general population. Moreover, higher disability was associated with worse socio-economic disadvantage. Prospective studies are needed to determine the direction of association.

Each cortical barrel receives information from thalamocortical (TC) cells that relay information from a single whisker, and TC input is decoded by barrel regular-spiking (RS) cells through a feedforward inhibitory architecture (with inhibition delivered by cortical fast-spiking or FS cells). TC cells encode deflection velocity through population synchrony, while deflection direction is encoded through the distribution of spike counts across the TC population. Barrel RS cells encode both deflection direction and velocity with spike rate, and are divided into functional domains by direction preference. Following repetitive whisker stimulation, system adaptation causes a weakening of synaptic inputs to RS cells and diminishes RS cell spike responses, though evidence suggests that stimulus discrimination may improve following adaptation.

Here, we used the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe as a model for understanding neurite guidance during development. We assessed the function of Sox102F/SoxD, the unique Drosophila orthologue of the vertebrate SoxD family of transcription factors. SoxD is expressed in immature and mature neurons in the larval and adult lobula plate ganglia (one of the optic lobe neuropils), but is absent from glial cells, neural stem cells and progenitors of the lobula plate. SoxD RNAi knockdown in all neurons results in a reduction of the lobula plate neuropil, without affecting neuronal fate. This morphological defect is associated with an impaired optomotor response of adult flies.

Dopamine signaling may impact neuronal activity by modulation of glutamate neurotransmission. Recent evidence indicates a direct and/or indirect involvement of fragile X-related family proteins (FXR) in the regulation and mediation of dopamine receptor functions. FXRs consists of fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (Fmr1/FMRP) and its autosomal homologs Fxr1 and Fxr2. These RNA-binding proteins are enriched in the brain. Loss of function mutation in human FMR1 is the major genetic contributor to Fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Therefore, the role of FXR proteins has mostly been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders. However, recent genome-wide association studies have linked this family to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and mood regulation pointing toward a broader involvement in mental illnesses. FXR family proteins play an important role in the regulation of glutamate-mediated neuronal activity and plasticity. Here, we discuss the brain-specific functions of FXR family proteins by focusing on the regulation of dopamine receptor functions, ionotropic glutamate receptors-mediated synaptic plasticity and contribution to mental illnesses. Based on recent evidence, we propose that FXR proteins are potential integrators of dopamine signaling and ionotropic glutamate transmission.", "datePublished": "2018-07-24T05:24:52Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnsyn.2018.00022/full"], "eissn": "1663-3563", "doi": "10.3389/fnsyn.2018.00022", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Spatial processing in binocular rivalry", "author": ["Thangaraj Phyllis M", "Vattikuti Shashaank", "Chow Carson C"], "datePublished": "2013-03-12T00:03:57Z", "url": [], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2202-13-S1-P166", "pissn": "1471-2202", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "The arithmetic problem size effect in children: an event-related potential study", "author": ["Leen eVan Beek", "Pol eGhesqui\u00e8re", "Bert eDe Smedt", "Lieven eLagae"], "description": "This study used for the first time event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the well-known arithmetic problem size effect in children.

Furthermore, weight loss interventions such as voluntary physical activity (PA) for adults with obesity or overweight was reported to promote pain reduction in humans with chronic pain. However, regardless of obesity status, it is not known whether HFD intake and sedentary (SED) behavior is underlies chronic pain susceptibility. Moreover, differential gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a crucial role in chronic pain susceptibility. Thus, the present study used an adapted model of the inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced persistent hyperalgesia short-term (PH-ST) protocol for mice, an HFD, and a voluntary PA paradigm to test these hypotheses. Therefore, we performed an analysis of differential gene expression using a transcriptome approach of the NAc. We also applied a gene ontology enrichment tools to identify biological processes associated with chronic pain susceptibility and to investigate the interaction between the factors studied: diet (standard diet vs. HFD), physical activity behavior (SED vs. PA) and PH-ST (PGE vs. saline). Our results demonstrated that HFD intake and sedentary behavior promoted chronic pain susceptibility, which in turn was prevented by voluntary physical activity, even when the animals were fed an HFD. The transcriptome of the NAc found 2,204 differential expression genes and gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed 41 biologic processes implicated in chronic pain susceptibility. Taking these biological processes together, our results suggest that genes related to metabolic and mitochondria stress were up-regulated in the chronic pain susceptibility group (SED-HFD-PGE), whereas genes related to neuroplasticity were up-regulated in the non-chronic pain susceptibility group (PA-HFD-PGE). These findings provide pieces of evidence that HFD intake and sedentary behavior provoked gene expression changes in the NAc related to promotion of chronic pain susceptibility, whereas voluntary physical activity provoked gene expression changes in the NAc related to prevention of chronic pain susceptibility. Finally, our findings confirmed previous literature supporting the crucial role of voluntary physical activity to prevent chronic pain and suggest that low levels of voluntary physical activity would be helpful and highly recommended as a complementary treatment for those with chronic pain.", "datePublished": "2020-01-22T04:56:00Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2019.01453/full"], "eissn": "1662-453X", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2019.01453", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Assessing Panic: Bridging the Gap Between Fundamental Mechanisms and Daily Life Experience", "author": ["Nicole K.

Motor neglect (MN) is a clinically important condition whereby patients with unilateral brain lesions fail to move their contralateral limbs, despite normal muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation. MN has been associated with various lesion sites, including the parietal and frontal cortex, the internal capsule, the lenticulostriate nuclei, and the thalamus. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that MN depends on a dysfunction of the medial motor system by performing a detailed anatomical analysis in four patients with MN.Methods. Ten patients participated in the study: four with MN, four with left visual neglect but without MN, and three patients with left hemiplegia without MN. We used specific scales for clinical and neuropsychological assessment. We drew the lesion borders directly onto the original brain images of each patient, and plotted the lesions on anatomical atlases for grey and white matter. Results. Lesion locations were highly heterogeneous in our MN patients, and included frontal and parietal sites, basal ganglia and white matter. The only consistently damaged structure across all MN patients was the cingulum bundle, a major pathway of the medial motor system important for motor initiative, and a key connection with limbic structures crucial for motivational aspects of actions. Three MN patients with additional damage to lateral fronto-parietal networks had also signs of contralesional visual neglect.

Early diagnosis and good glycemic control should start as early as possible to delay and prevent metabolic and cardio-vascular complications secondary to this disease. Glycated hemoglobin is currently used as the reference parameter. The accuracy of the glycated hemoglobin dosage may be compromised in subjects suffering from chronic renal failure and terminal nephropathy, affected by the reduction in the survival of erythrocytes, with consequent decrease in the time available for glucose to attach to the hemoglobin. In the presence of these renal comorbidities as well as hemoglobinopathies and pregnancy, glycated hemoglobin is not reliable. In such conditions, dosage of glycated albumin can help. Glycated albumin is not only useful for short-term diagnosis and monitoring but predicts the risk of diabetes, even in the presence of euglycemia. This protein is modified in subjects who do not yet have a glycemic alteration but, as a predictive factor, heralds the risk of diabetic disease.

Alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways participate in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in LVH and HF. cAMP signals are received and integrated by a family of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) anchor proteins (AKAPs), tethering PKA to discrete cellular locations. AKAPs encoded by the Akap1 gene (mitoAKAPs) promote PKA mitochondrial targeting, regulating mitochondrial structure and function, reactive oxygen species production, and cell survival. To determine the role of mitoAKAPs in LVH development, in the present investigation, mice with global genetic deletion of Akap1 (Akap1-/-), Akap1 heterozygous (Akap1+/-), and their wild-type (wt) littermates underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or SHAM procedure for 1 week. In wt mice, pressure overload induced the downregulation of AKAP121, the major cardiac mitoAKAP. Compared to wt, Akap1-/- mice did not display basal alterations in cardiac structure or function and cardiomyocyte size or fibrosis. However, loss of Akap1 exacerbated LVH and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and accelerated the progression toward HF in TAC mice, and these changes were not observed upon prevention of AKAP121 degradation in seven in absentia homolog 2 (Siah2) knockout mice (Siah2-/-). Loss of Akap1 was also associated to a significant increase in cardiac apoptosis as well as lack of activation of Akt signaling after pressure overload. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in vivo genetic deletion of Akap1 enhances LVH development and accelerates pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction, pointing at Akap1 as a novel repressor of pathological LVH.

Our previous work has shown that T-lymphocytes exposed to elevated levels of norepinephrine (NE) displayed a pro-inflammatory signature reminiscent of an autoreactive phenotype. With this, we hypothesized that the increased sympathetic tone observed during psychological trauma may be promoting pro-inflammatory T-lymphocytes, which causes a predisposition to comorbid inflammatory conditions. Here, we examined the consequences of psychological trauma on splenic T-lymphocytes using a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress. Social defeat led to anxiety-like and depression-like behavior as has been previously described. The spleens of socially-defeated mice showed significant elevations of NE, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) levels, which appeared to be due in part to increased expression within T-lymphocytes. Additionally, T-lymphocytes from stressed animals showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial superoxide. Interestingly, in this model system, close associations exist within splenic T-lymphocytes amid the autonomic, inflammatory, and redox environments, but these only weakly correlate with individual behavioral differences among animals suggesting the psychological and physiological manifestations of trauma may not be tightly coupled. Last, we describe, for the first time, elevations in calprotectin levels within T-lymphocytes and in circulation of psychologically stressed animals.

High-mobility group A1 (HMGA1), well-known chromatin remodeling proteins, play pivotal roles in diverse biological processes and diseases. Their function in neural cell death in PD, however, have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that HMGA1 is highly induced during dopaminergic cell death in vitro and mice models of PD in vivo. Functional studies using genetic knockdown of endogenous HMGA1 show that HMGA1 signaling inhibition accelerates neural cell death, at least partially through aggravating MPP+-induced autophagic flux reduction resulting from partial block in autophagic flux at the terminal stages, indicating a novel potential neuroprotective role for HMGA1 in dopaminergic neurons death. MicroRNA-103/107 (miR-103/107) family, which is highly expressed in neuron, coordinately ensures proper end-stage autophagy. We further illustrate that MPP+/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced HMGA1 elevation counterparts the effect of miR-103/107 downregulation by directly binding to their promoters, respectively, sustaining their expression in MPP+-damaged MN9D cells and modulates autophagy through CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling pathway. We also find that HMGA1 is a direct target of miR-103/107 family. Thus, our results suggest that HMGA1 forms a negative feedback loop with miR-103/107-CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling to regulate the MPP+/MPTP-induced autophagy impairment and neural cell death.

In this review, we describe that the functional interaction between these cytokines in the brain differs from the periphery (e.g. their expression is not induced by each other) and present data showing predominantly a toxic effect of these cytokines when expressed at high doses and for a sustained period of time in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN). In addition, we highlight opposite evidence showing protective effects of these two main cytokines when conditions of duration, amount of expression or state of activation of the target or neighboring cells are changed. Furthermore, we discuss these results in the frame of previous disappointing results from anti-TNF clinical trials against Multiple Sclerosis, another neurodegenerative disease with a clear neuroinflammatory component. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the available evidence suggests that the duration and dose of IL-1 or TNF expression is crucial to predict their functional effect on the SN. Since these parameters are not amenable for measurement in the SN of PD patients, we call for an in-depth analysis to identify downstream mediators that could be common to the toxic (and not the protective) effects of these cytokines in the SN. This strategy could spare the possible neuroprotective effect of these cytokines operative in the patient at the time of treatment, increasing the probability of efficacy in a clinical setting. Alternatively, receptor-specific agonists or antagonists could also provide a way to circumvent undesired effects of general anti-inflammatory or specific anti IL-1 or TNF therapies against PD.", "datePublished": "2014-05-22T09:39:56Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncel.2013.00053/full"], "eissn": "1662-5102", "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2013.00053", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Evaluating persistence of shape information using a matching protocol", "author": ["Ernest Greene", "Hautus Michael J"], "description": "Many laboratories have studied persistence of shape information, the goal being to better understand how the visual system mediates recognition of objects. Most have asked for recognition of known shapes, <em>e.g</em>., letters of the alphabet, or recall from an array. Recognition of known shapes requires access to long-term memory, so it is not possible to know whether the experiment is assessing short-term encoding and working memory mechanisms, or has encountered limitations on retrieval from memory stores. Here we have used an inventory of unknown shapes, wherein a string of discrete dots forms the boundary of each shape. Each was displayed as a target only once to a given respondent, with recognition being tested using a matching task. Analysis based on signal detection theory was used to provide an unbiased estimate of the probability of correct decisions about whether comparison shapes matched target shapes. Four experiments were conducted, which found the following: a) Shapes were identified with a high probability of being correct with dot densities ranging from 20% to 4%. Performance dropped only about 10% across this density range. b) Shape identification levels remained very high with up to 500 milliseconds of target and comparison shape separation. c) With one-at-a-time display of target dots, varying the total time for a given display, the proportion of correct decisions dropped only about 10% even with a total display time of 500 milliseconds. d) With display of two complementary target subsets, also varying the total time of each display, there was a dramatic decline of proportion correct that reached chance levels by 500 milliseconds. The greater rate of decline for the two-pulse condition may be due to a mechanism that registers when the number of dots is sufficient to create a shape summary. Once a summary is produced, the temporal window that allows shape information to be added may be more limited.", "datePublished": "2018-04-04T08:18:07Z", "url": ["http://www.aimspress.com/neuroscience/article/1822/fulltext.html"], "pissn": "2373-7972", "doi": "10.3934/Neuroscience.2018.1.81", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Cue-Evoked Dopamine Neuron Activity Helps Maintain but Does Not Encode Expected Value", "author": ["Jesse A.

In mice performing a trial-based operant task, we test if bidirectional manipulations of cue or operant-associated DA neuron activity drive learning as a result of under- or overexpectation of reward value. We target optogenetic manipulations to different components of forced trials, when only one lever is presented, and assess lever biases on choice trials in the absence of photomanipulation. Although lever biases are demonstrated to be flexible and sensitive to changes in expected value, augmentation of cue or operant-associated DA signaling does not significantly alter choice behavior, and blunting DA signaling during any component of the forced trials reduces choice trial responses on the associated lever. These data suggest cue-evoked DA helps maintain cue-value associations but does not encode expected value as to set the benchmark against which received reward is judged. : Although reward-predictive cues increase midbrain dopamine neuron activity in proportion to the expected value of the anticipated reward, Mendoza et\u00a0al. demonstrate that cue-evoked dopamine does not prospectively encode expected value as to influence reward assessment.

This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism.

Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice.

Cholesterol (Chol) localizes in both hemilayers, but in the external one it is mostly condensed in lipid-ordered microdomains (raft domains), together with saturated phosphatidyl lipids and sphingolipids (including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids). Membrane asymmetries induce special membrane biophysical properties and behave as signals for several physiological and/or pathological processes. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is associated with a perturbation in different membrane properties. Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein together with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the most characteristic cellular changes observed in this disease. The extracellular presence of A\u03b2 peptides forming senile plaques, together with soluble oligomeric species of A\u03b2, are considered the major cause of the synaptic dysfunction of AD. The association between A\u03b2 peptide and membrane lipids has been extensively studied. It has been postulated that Chol content and Chol distribution condition A\u03b2 production and posterior accumulation in membranes and, hence, cell dysfunction. Several lines of evidence suggest that A\u03b2 partitions in the cell membrane accumulate mostly in raft domains, the site where the cleavage of the precursor A\u03b2PP by \u03b2- and \u03b3- secretase is also thought to occur. The main consequence of the pathogenesis of AD is the disruption of the cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and in the basal forebrain. In parallel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been extensively linked to membrane properties. Since its transmembrane domain exhibits extensive contacts with the surrounding lipids, the acetylcholine receptor function is conditioned by its lipid microenvironment. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is present in high-density clusters in the cell membrane where it localizes mainly in lipid-ordered domains. Perturbations of sphingomyelin or cholesterol composition alter acetylcholine receptor location. Therefore, A\u03b2 processing, A\u03b2 partitioning, and acetylcholine receptor location and function can be manipulated by changes in membrane lipid biophysics. Understanding these mechanisms should provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for prevention and/or treatment of AD.

We aimed to explore the effects of D3NB treatment on hippocampal neuronal death after CCH as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. We observed memory impairment and increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in the CCH groups, combined with inhibition of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, as compared with that of sham control rats. D3NB significantly attenuated cognitive impairment in CCH rats and decreased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis after BCCAO in vivo or OGD/R in vitro. More importantly, D3NB reversed the inhibition of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1 expression and activated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 counteracted the protective effects of D3NB in vitro. Our results suggest that D3NB could improve cognitive function after CCH and that this neuroprotective effect may be associated with reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis via modulation of CNTF/CNTFR\u03b1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.

Our results show that the morphology of the film and the species of graphene (GO, PRGO, or FRGO) influences the behavior and function of these neurons.

Analysis of cell viability and cytotoxicity showed good cell survival, a lack of cell death in all GO forms and its derivatives, a decreased proliferation, and increased differentiation over time. Neuronal maturation of SN4741 in all GO forms, and its derivatives were assessed by increased protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), the glutamate inward rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2), and of synaptic proteins, such as synaptobrevin and synaptophysin. Notably, PRGO-film increased the levels of Tuj1 and the expression of transcription factors specific for midbrain DA neurons, such as Pitx3, Lmx1a, and Lmx1b. Bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption modified by distinct GO species and were different between powder and film for the same GO species.

In the brain, high levels of the wolframin protein have been observed in the hippocampus, amygdala and limbic structures.

We recently advanced the idea that ALS might be caused by fungal infection. Indeed, fungal yeast and hyphal structures can be directly visualized in neural tissue of ALS patients, and a number of fungal species have been identified in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present work, we tested the possibility that bacterial infections can accompany these mycoses. Our findings establish the presence of bacterial DNA in different regions of the CNS from all ALS patients examined. Specifically, we used PCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) to precisely determine the bacterial species present in ALS tissue. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemistry analysis of CNS sections using specific anti-bacterial antibodies identified prokaryotic cells in neural tissue. Finally, we assayed for the repeat expansion of the hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in C9orf72, which is considered the most common genetic cause of ALS in patients, using DNA extracted from ALS CNS tissue.

Miller"], "description": "Introduction: Patients with glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors, exhibit a wide range of neurologic signs, ranging from headaches to neurologic deficits and cognitive impairment, at first clinical presentation. While such variability is attributed to inter-individual differences in increased intracranial pressure, tumor infiltration, and vascular compromise, a direct association with disease stage, tumor size and location, edema, and necrotic cell death has yet to be established. The lack of specificity of neurologic symptoms often confounds the diagnosis of GBM. It also limits clinicians\u2019 ability to elect treatment regimens that not only prolong survival but also promote symptom management and high quality of life.Methods: To decipher the heterogeneous presentation of neurologic symptoms in GBM, we investigated differences in the molecular makeup of tumors from patients with and without preoperative neurologic deficits. We used the Ivy GAP (Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project) database to integrate RNA sequencing data from histologically defined GBM tumor compartments and neurologic examination records for 41 patients. We investigated the association of neurologic deficits with various tumor and patient attributes. We then performed differential gene expression and co-expression network analysis to identify a transcriptional signature specific to neurologic deficits in GBM. Using functional enrichment analysis, we finally provided a comprehensive and detailed characterization of involved pathways and gene interactions.Results: An exploratory investigation of the association of tumor and patient variables with the early development of neurologic deficits in GBM revealed a lack of robust and consistent clinicopathologic prognostic factors. We detected significant differences in the expression of 728 genes (FDR-adjusted p-value \u2264 0.05 and relative fold-change \u2265 1.5), unique to the cellular tumor (CT) anatomical compartment, between neurologic deficit groups. Upregulated differentially expressed genes in CT were enriched for mesenchymal subtype-predictive genes. Applying a systems approach, we then identified co-expressed gene sets that correlated with neurological deficit manifestation (FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.1). Collectively, these findings uncovered significantly enriched immune activation, oxidative stress response, and cytokine-mediated proinflammatory processes.Conclusion: Our study posits that inflammatory processes, as well as a mesenchymal tumor subtype, are implicated in the pathophysiology of preoperative neurologic deficits in GBM.", "datePublished": "2019-06-04T15:44:18Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2019.00488/full"], "eissn": "1664-8021", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2019.00488", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Mutant Mice Exhibit Reduced Brain Tissue Stiffness Compared to Wild-type Mice in both Normoxia and following Intermittent Hypoxia Mimicking Sleep Apnea", "author": ["Maria Jos\u00e9 Menal", "Ignasi Jorba", "Ignasi Jorba", "Marta Torres", "Marta Torres", "Josep M.

Together with use of induced pluripotent stem cells or/and CRISPR-based recombineering the retinal organoid technology provided an avenue for developing models of human retinal degenerative diseases \u201cin a dish\u201d for studying the pathology, delineating the mechanisms and also establishing a platform for large-scale drug screening. At the same time, retinal organoids, highly resembling developing human fetal retinal tissue, are viewed as source of multipotential retinal progenitors, young photoreceptors and just the whole retinal tissue, which may be transplanted into the subretinal space with a goal of replacing patient\u2019s degenerated retina with a new retinal \u201cpatch.\u201d Both approaches (transplantation and modeling/drug screening) were projected when Yoshiki Sasai demonstrated the feasibility of deriving mammalian retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells, and generated a lot of excitement. With further work and testing of both approaches in vitro and in vivo, a major implicit limitation has become apparent pretty quickly: the absence of the uniform layer of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells, which is normally present in mammalian retina, surrounds photoreceptor layer and develops and matures first. The RPE layer polarize into apical and basal sides during development and establish microvilli on the apical side, interacting with photoreceptors, nurturing photoreceptor outer segments and participating in the visual cycle by recycling 11-trans retinal (bleached pigment) back to 11-cis retinal. Retinal organoids, however, either do not have RPE layer or carry patches of RPE mostly on one side, thus directly exposing most photoreceptors in the developing organoids to neural medium. Recreation of the critical retinal niche between the apical RPE and photoreceptors, where many retinal disease mechanisms originate, is so far unattainable, imposes clear limitations on both modeling/drug screening and transplantation approaches and is a focus of investigation in many labs.

Among these disorders, ischemic injury is a prominent cause of death and disability worldwide. Brain ischemia stems from cardiac arrest or stroke, both responsible for insufficient blood supply to the brain parenchyma. Glucose and oxygen deficiency disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, which results in energy depletion and ionic imbalance, followed by cell membrane depolarization, calcium (Ca2+) overload, and extracellular accumulation of excitatory amino acid glutamate. If tight physiological regulation fails to clear the surplus of this neurotransmitter, subsequent prolonged activation of glutamate receptors forms a vicious circle between elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ ions and aberrant glutamate release, aggravating the effect of this ischemic pathway. The activation of downstream Ca2+-dependent enzymes has a catastrophic impact on nervous tissue leading to cell death, accompanied by the formation of free radicals, edema, and inflammation. After decades of \u201cneuron-centric\u201d approaches, recent research has also finally shed some light on the role of glial cells in neurological diseases. It is becoming more and more evident that neurons and glia depend on each other. Neuronal cells, astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia, and oligodendrocytes all have their roles in what is known as glutamate excitotoxicity. However, who is the main contributor to the ischemic pathway, and who is the unsuspecting victim?

This observation might pave the way for novel closed-loop approaches comprising a cortical sensor. Enhanced beta oscillations (13-35 Hz) have been linked to the pathophysiology of PD and may serve as such a candidate marker to localize a cortical area reliably modulated by DBS. However, beta-oscillations are widely distributed over the cortical surface, necessitating an additional signal source for spotting the cortical area linked to the pathologically synchronized cortico-subcortical motor network.In this context, both cortico-subthalamic coherence and cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) have been studied in PD patients. Whereas the former requires invasive recordings, the latter allows for non-invasive detection, but displays a rather distributed cortical synchronization pattern in motor tasks. This distributed cortical representation may conflict with the goal of detecting a cortical localization with robust biomarker properties which is detectable on a single subject basis. We propose that this limitation could be overcome when recording CMC at rest. We hypothesized that \u2013 unlike healthy subjects \u2013 PD would show CMC at rest owing to the enhanced beta oscillations observed in PD. By performing source space analysis of beta CMC recorded during resting-state magnetoencephalography, we provide preliminary evidence in one patient for a cortical hot spot that is modulated most strongly by subthalamic DBS.

Traditional models of neglect have focused on impaired spatial attention as the core deficit and as such, most rehabilitation methods have tried to improve attentional processes. However, many of these techniques (e.g., visual scanning training, caloric stimulation, neck muscle vibration) produce only short-lived effects, or are too uncomfortable to use as a routine treatment. More recently, many investigators have begun examining the beneficial effects of prism adaptation for the treatment of neglect. Although prism adaptation has been shown to have some beneficial effects on both overt and covert spatial attention, it does not reliably alter many of the perceptual biases evident in neglect. One of the challenges of neglect rehabilitation may lie in the heterogeneous nature of the deficits. Most notably, a number of researchers have shown that neglect patients present with severe deficits in spatial working memory (SWM) in addition to their attentional impairment. Given that SWM can be seen as a foundational cognitive mechanism, critical for a wide range of other functions, any deficit in SWM memory will undoubtedly have severe consequences. In the current review we examine the evidence for SWM deficits in neglect and propose that it constitutes a core component of the syndrome. We present preliminary data which suggest that at least one current rehabilitation method (prism adaptation) has no effect on SWM deficits in neglect. Finally, we end by reviewing recent work that examines the effectiveness of SWM training and how SWM training may prove to be a useful avenue for future rehabilitative efforts in patients with neglect.", "datePublished": "2014-05-22T09:40:40Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00334/full"], "eissn": "1662-5161", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00334", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "SpykeTorch: Efficient Simulation of Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks With at Most One Spike per Neuron", "author": ["Milad Mozafari", "Milad Mozafari", "Mohammad Ganjtabesh", "Abbas Nowzari-Dalini", "Timoth\u00e9e Masquelier"], "description": "Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient.

Additionally, it compared the effect of location and number of points of contact to the control of posture in young adults. The location consisted of using the anchors tied to the finger and held by the hands, and, for LT, the fingertip. For the number of points of contact, participants used two hands, and then separately the dominant hand, and the non-dominant hand, for both anchor and LT paradigms. Participants stood upright with feet-together and in tandem position while performing tasks that combined the use of anchors and LT, points of contact (hand grip and finger), and number of points of contact (two hands and one hand). In this study, the anchors consist of holding in each hand a flexible cable with the other end attached to the ground. The LT consists of slightly touching a rigid surface with the tip of the index finger. The results showed, first, that the anchors improved postural control less than did the LT. Second, they revealed that holding the anchors with the hands or with them tied to the fingertip resulted in a similar reduction in postural sway only in the tandem position. For the feet-together position, the anchors tied to the fingertip were ineffective. Similarly, the use of one or two hands did not affect the contribution of the anchors. However, using two hands in the LT condition was more effective than was one hand. Third, our results showed the presence of a temporal delay between force and center-of-pressure (COP) for the anchors, only in the AP direction with feet-together. In conclusion, overall, the anchors were less effective in reducing postural sway than was the LT. The anchors attached to fingertips were as effective as the hand-held anchors in the tandem position, yet ineffective during foot-together standing.

Early life antibiotic use is one factor which may contribute to immune dysfunction and the recent surge in allergies by virtue of its effects on gut microbiota. Objective and methods As a first step towards determining whether a relationship exists between perinatal antibiotic induced changes in the gut microbiota and the later development of a peanut allergy, we exposed newborn mice to either the broad-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin or to a vehicle for 6\u00a0weeks and then used a novel murine model of peanut allergy. Results Early-life treatment with vancomycin resulted in a significant shift in the gut microbiota community characterized by a reduction in the abundance of firmicutes and preponderance of inflammatory proteobacteria. Mice with an antibiotic-altered microbiota, showed a localized allergic-like response characterized by ear swelling and scratching following intra-dermal peanut antigen challenge. Likewise, circulating IgE levels were increased in antibiotic-treated mice, but no evidence of a systemic allergic or anaphylactic-like response was observed. Importantly, we utilized the naturally occurring pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), rather than the more commonly used cholera toxin, as an adjuvant together with the peanut antigen. Conclusion Our data suggest that early antibiotic exposure promotes a shift in the gut microbiota community that may in turn, influence how mice later respond to a TNF-\u03b1\u2009+\u2009antigen challenge. However, further studies verifying the capacity of microbiota restoration to protect against allergic responses will be needed to confirm a causal role of antibiotic-induced microbiota variations in promoting allergic disease phenotypes.", "datePublished": "2018-11-04T12:32:03Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13223-018-0263-8"], "doi": "10.1186/s13223-018-0263-8", "eissn": "1710-1492", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "The Cardiorespiratory Network in Healthy First-Degree Relatives of Schizophrenic Patients", "author": ["Steffen Schulz", "Jens Haueisen", "Karl-J\u00fcrgen B\u00e4r", "Andreas Voss"], "description": "Impaired heart rate- and respiratory regulatory processes as a sign of an autonomic dysfunction seems to be obviously present in patients suffering from schizophrenia.

To answer this, we derive a bound for a general measure of variability -- spike-train entropy. This leads to important insights on the variability of multi-cell spike pattern distributions in large recurrent networks of spiking neurons responding to fluctuating inputs. The analysis is based on results from random dynamical systems theory and is complemented by detailed numerical simulations. We find that the spike pattern entropy is an order of magnitude lower than what would be extrapolated from single cells.  This holds despite the fact that network coupling becomes vanishingly sparse as network size grows -- a phenomenon that depends on ``extensive chaos, as previously discovered for balanced networks without stimulus drive.

Susceptibility values of bilateral ROIs were calculated and compared between the affected side and unaffected side in patients with MCAO and between patients with MCAO and healthy controls. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the diagnostic capability of susceptibility values in differentiating healthy controls and patients with MCAO by the area under the curve (AUC).Results: The susceptibility values of bilateral Cd were asymmetric in healthy controls; however, this asymmetry disappeared in patients with MCAO.

We provide an analytic model to analyze network bursts generated by coupled adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons.

Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates.Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs.Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.", "datePublished": "2020-11-09T04:29:11Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.595751/full"], "eissn": "1663-4365", "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2020.595751", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Placental Circulation Intact Trial (PCI-T)\u2014Resuscitation With the Placental Circulation Intact vs. Cord Milking for Very Preterm Infants: A Feasibility Study", "author": ["Simone Pratesi", "Simona Montano", "Stefano Ghirardello", "Fabio Mosca", "Luca Boni", "Lorenzo Tofani", "Carlo Dani"], "description": "Background: Preterm newborns receiving briefly delayed cord clamping or cord milking at birth have better neonatal outcomes. However, the time frame in which both these procedures are performed (&lt; 60 s of life) is too short to explore the possible beneficial effects on early infant postnatal adaptation and outcomes of a prolonged transfusion strategy associated with neonatal respiration.Methods and Design: We have designed a randomized, multicenter, controlled two-phase study: phase 1 to assess the feasibility of carrying out the protocol in a large randomized trial, and phase 2 to assess the efficacy of bedside assistance with intact placental circulation for 3 min in comparison to cord milking to improve outcome in the neonatal period; we present here the feasibility and safety phase of the study. Outcomes included feasibility (recruitment rate of two patients per month, compliance with the trial interventions, completeness of data collection, &gt;90% of infants receiving echographic assessments in the first 24 h) and safety variables (5 min Apgar score, delivery room intubation rate, CRIB II score, admission temperature, maximum hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit in the first 24 h and maximum serum bilirubin value) in the two study groups. We also evaluated the same safety variables in infants delivered during the study period but not recruited.Results: A total of 40 infants were enrolled. In all cases the protocol was completed and all feasibility outcomes were reached. Infants assisted with an intact placental circulation have a higher 5 min Apgar score but their admission temperature was lower than milked infants. Delivery room intubation rate, CRIB II score and peak serum bilirubin value were comparable in both groups. Infants who were not subjected to a placental transfusion strategy (excluded patients) had a higher delivery room intubation rate with respect to both study groups.Conclusion: Delaying cord clamping until 3 min of life was challenging but feasible and appeared to be safe. However, admission temperature must be strictly monitored and a more efficacious warming system could be implemented to prevent hypothermia during the procedure.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials,gov NCT02671305 (date of registration: 26 JAN 2016). https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02671305", "datePublished": "2018-11-27T05:08:24Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fped.2018.00364/full"], "eissn": "2296-2360", "doi": "10.3389/fped.2018.00364", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Word wins over Face: Emotional Stroop effect activates the frontal cortical network", "author": ["Shima Ovaysikia", "Jason L  Chan", "Khalid Tahir", "Joseph F X  DeSouza"], "description": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in higher order cognitive control of behaviour. Sometimes such control is executed through suppression of an unwanted response in order to avoid conflict. Conflict occurs when two simultaneously competing processes lead to different behavioral outcomes, as seen in tasks such as the anti-saccade, go/no-go and the Stroop task. We set out to examine whether different types of stimuli in a modified emotional Stroop task would cause similar interference effects as the original Stroop-colour/word, and whether the required suppression mechanism(s) would recruit similar regions of the medial PFC (mPFC). By using emotional words and emotional faces in this Stroop experiment, we examined the two well-learned automatic behaviours of word reading and recognition of face expressions. In our emotional Stroop paradigm, words were processed faster than face expressions with incongruent trials yielding longer reaction times (RT) and larger number of errors compared to the congruent trials. This novel Stroop effect activated the anterior and inferior regions of the mPFC, namely the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as well as the superior frontal gyrus. Our results suggest that prepotent behaviours such as reading and recognition of face expressions are stimulus-dependent and perhaps hierarchical, hence recruiting distinct regions of the mPFC.  Moreover, the faster processing of word reading compared to reporting face expressions is indicative of the formation of stronger stimulus-response (SR) associations of an over-learned behaviour compared to an instinctive one, which could alternatively be explained through the distinction between awareness and selective attention.", "datePublished": "2014-05-22T09:31:15Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00234/full"], "eissn": "1662-5161", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2010.00234", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Evaluation of social cognitive measures in an Asian schizophrenia sample", "author": ["Keane Lim", "Sara-Ann Lee", "Amy E.

However, few studies have examined the psychometrics of multiple social cognition measures in an Asian population. This study aims to evaluate the psychometrics of measures indexing the four core social cognition domains. Methods: Schizophrenia outpatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0116) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a073) completed a battery of nine social cognitive measures, twice, four weeks apart. Psychometric properties were examined via test-retest reliability, internal consistency, utility as a repeated measure, time administration, and tolerability. Logistic regression was performed to identify psychometrically sound tasks that best discriminated case-control status. PCA was conducted to explore social cognition dimensional structure. Results: The Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task (BLERT), Penn Emotion Recognition Task (ER40), and The Awareness of Social Inference Test, branch III (TASIT-3) showed strongest psychometrics. The Ambiguous Intentions and Hostility Questionnaire, Hostility Bias subscale (AIHQ-HB) showed slightly weaker properties, requiring further evaluation. The Hinting task, Mini Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (MiniPONS), Relationships Across Domains (RAD), Internal Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ), and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) showed poorer psychometrics in our sample. PCA revealed a two-factor solution comprising social cognition skills and attributional style/bias. Conclusion: Here, we examined the psychometric properties of a comprehensive social cognition battery based on the SCOPE study in an Asian schizophrenia population. Continued evaluation and standardization of social cognitive measures are needed to refine our understanding of this construct in schizophrenia.

Eye Movement Desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy could be an effective psychotherapy to treat a PPS and prior psychological traumas in this population.ObjectivesTo assess if EMDR therapy leads to: 1) a reduction of relapses after intervention, 2) an improvement of trauma-related, psychotic and affective symptoms, 3) an improvement of overall functioning, and 4) an improvement in quality of life.MethodsThis is a multicenter phase II rater-blinded randomized controlled trial in which 80 FEP patients with a history of psychological trauma will be randomly assigned to EMDR (n = 40) or to TAU (n = 40). Traumatic events will be measured by the Global Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Questionnaire, the Cumulative Trauma Screening, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Childhood Trauma Scale, the Holmes\u2013Rahe Life Stress Inventory, and the Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire. Clinical symptomatology will be evaluated using the Suicide and Drug Consumption module of the International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Structured Clinical Interview for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young\u2019s Scale for Mania Evaluation, and Beck Depression II Questionnaire. Functionality will be assessed with the Global Assessment of Functioning and the Quality of Life with the Standardized Instrument developed by the EuroQol Group. The cognitive insight and adherence to the treatment will be assessed with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale and the Drug Attitude Inventory. All variables will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and at 12-month follow-up.ConclusionThis study will provide evidence of whether EMDR therapy is effective in reducing trauma and clinical symptoms, reducing relapses and in improving functionality and quality of life in patients with FEP and a history of trauma.Clinical Trial Registrationwww.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03991377", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T13:48:03Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.01023/full"], "eissn": "1664-0640", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2019.01023", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Corrigendum: Spectral Entropy Based Neuronal Network Synchronization Analysis Based on Microelectrode Array Measurements", "author": ["Fikret E.

After ischemia the early massive increase of extracellular glutamate is followed by activation of resident immune cells, that is, microglia, and production or activation of inflammation mediators.

All tumors were reviewed histologically and subjected to array-based methylation analysis followed by algorithm-based classification into distinct methylation classes (MCs). The single MC containing the largest proportion of 25 tumors diagnosed as cGBM was MC anaplastic astrocytoma with piloid features representing a recently-described molecular tumor entity not yet included in the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (WHO classification). Twenty-nine tumors molecularly corresponded to either of 6 methylation subclasses subsumed in the MC family GBM IDH wildtype. Further we identified 6 tumors belonging to the MC diffuse midline glioma H3 K27\u2009M mutant and 6 tumors allotted to the MC IDH mutant glioma subclass astrocytoma. Two tumors were classified as MC pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa, one as MC CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration and one as MC control tissue, inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The methylation profiles of 16 tumors could not clearly be assigned to one distinct MC. In comparison to supratentorial localization, the MC GBM IDH wildtype subclass midline was overrepresented, whereas the MCs GBM IDH wildtype subclass mesenchymal and subclass RTK II were underrepresented in the cerebellum. Based on the integration of molecular and histological findings all tumors received an integrated diagnosis in line with the WHO classification 2016. In conclusion, cGBM does not represent a molecularly uniform tumor entity, but rather comprises different brain tumor entities with diverse prognosis and therapeutic options. Distinction of these molecular tumor classes requires molecular analysis.

This focus is central to the use of communication skills related to empathy and even more crucial to provide information in a way that makes patients feel more involved in the treatment process. Psychoanalysis (PA) provides its initial concept of empathy based on affective aspects including findings from neuroscience and brain research. Enhancing cooperation between ME and PA can help to integrate both aspects of empathy into a longitudinal training program. Discussion The condition of psychoanalytic empathy definitions is the understanding of unconscious processes. It is important to primarily attend especially the dominant \ufeffaffects towards the patient before interpreting his or her behaviour, since in explaining the emerging affects, the analyst has to empathize with the patient to understand the (unconscious) reasons for its behaviour. A strong consideration of nonverbal communication, clinical perceptions, intuitive interaction, contagion-like processes and their implementation and empowerment in medical and therapeutic curricula is one way of beneficially using interdisciplinary approaches to yield empathy in clinical interaction. Conclusion Established methods of PA, like training of containment, reflective functioning, affective holding and giving meaningful interpretations in accordance with countertransferential and transferential aspects may help to put a focus on the clinican-patient-interaction and the preservation of the physicians\u2019 (mental) health. In consequence of the discussion of various training methods that take the theoretical and practical concepts\u00a0of empathy into account, we aim for an implementation of the named methods in the medical curricula.", "datePublished": "2018-08-14T11:50:05Z", "url": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12909-017-0907-2"], "doi": "10.1186/s12909-017-0907-2", "eissn": "1472-6920", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Behavioral Phenotyping of Dopamine Transporter Knockout Rats: Compulsive Traits, Motor Stereotypies, and Anhedonia", "author": ["Stefano Cinque", "Stefano Cinque", "Francesca Zoratto", "Anna Poleggi", "Damiana Leo", "Luca Cerniglia", "Silvia Cimino", "Renata Tambelli", "Enrico Alleva", "Raul R.

Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) mice, in particular, have been widely used to study ADHD. Recently, a strain of DAT KO rats has been developed (1). Here, we provide a phenotypic characterization of reward sensitivity and compulsive choice by adult rats born from DAT\u2013HET dams bred with DAT\u2013HET males, in order to further validate DAT KO rats as an animal model for preclinical research. We first tested DAT KO rats\u2019 sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, provided by highly appetitive food or sweet water; then, we tested their choice behavior with an Intolerance-to-Delay Task (IDT). During these tests, DAT KO rats appeared less sensitive to rewarding stimuli than wild-type (WT) and HET rats: they also showed a prominent hyperactive behavior with a rigid choice pattern and a wide number of compulsive stereotypies. Moreover, during the IDT, we tested the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and RO-5203648, a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial agonist. AMPH accentuated impulsive behaviors in WT and HET rats, while it had no effect in DAT KO rats. Finally, we measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine receptor 2 (D2), serotonin transporter, and TAAR1 mRNA transcripts in samples of ventral striatum, finding no significant differences between WT and KO genotypes.

The reference lists of published review articles were scrutinised for additional relevant publications. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and three reviewed full texts of relevant articles. The protocol for this Review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016041392). 245 articles (204 primary research articles and 41 reviews) were included, with most primary research (183 [90%]) done in high-income countries. A high lifetime prevalence of health problems, risks, and conditions was reported in detained adolescents, including mental disorders (0\u201395%), substance use disorders (22\u201396%), self-harm (12\u201365%), neurodevelopmental disabilities (2\u201347%), infectious diseases (0\u201334%), and sexual and reproductive conditions (pregnant by age 19 years 20\u201337%; abnormal cervical screening test result 16%). Various physical and mental health problems and health-risk behaviours are more common among adolescents in detention than among their peers who have not been detained. As the social and structural drivers of poor health overlap somewhat with factors associated with exposure to the criminal justice system, strategies to address these factors could help to reduce both rates of adolescent detention and adolescent health inequalities.

Locally triggered release of GABA from the large reciprocal GC spines occurs on both fast and slow time scales, possibly enabling parallel processing during olfactory perception. Here we investigate local mechanisms for asynchronous spine output. To reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of postsynaptic ion transients, we imaged spine and adjacent dendrite Ca2 +- and Na+-signals with minimal exogenous buffering by the respective fluorescent indicator dyes upon two-photon uncaging of DNI-glutamate in OB slices from juvenile rats. Both postsynaptic fluorescence signals decayed slowly, with average half durations in the spine head of t1/2_\u0394[Ca2 +]i \u223c500 ms and t1/2_\u0394[Na+]i \u223c1,000 ms. We also analyzed the kinetics of already existing data of postsynaptic spine Ca2 +-signals in response to glomerular stimulation in OB slices from adult mice, either WT or animals with partial GC glutamate receptor deletions (NMDAR: GluN1 subunit; AMPAR: GluA2 subunit). In a large subset of spines the fluorescence signal had a protracted rise time (average time to peak \u223c400 ms, range 20 to &gt;1,000 ms). This slow rise was independent of Ca2 + entry via NMDARs, since similarly slow signals occurred in \u0394GluN1 GCs. Additional Ca2 + entry in \u0394GluA2 GCs (with AMPARs rendered Ca2 +-permeable), however, resulted in larger \u0394F/Fs that rose yet more slowly.

Among environmental challenges, homeostatic responses to temperature extremes are critical to animal survival under natural conditions. We previously reported that axon terminal arborization in Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions is enhanced at elevated temperatures; however, the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) remains unaltered despite the increase in synaptic bouton numbers. Here we determine the cellular basis of this homeostatic adjustment in larvae reared at high temperature (HT, 29 \u02daC). We found that synaptic current focally recorded from individual synaptic boutons was unaffected by rearing temperature (<15 \u02daC to >30 \u02daC). However, HT rearing decreased the quantal size (amplitude of spontaneous miniature EJPs, or mEJPs), which compensates for the increased number of synaptic releasing sites to retain a normal EJP size. The quantal size decrease is accounted for by a decrease in input resistance of the postsynaptic muscle fiber, indicating an increase in membrane area that matches the synaptic growth at HT. Interestingly, a mutation in rutabaga (rut) encoding adenylyl cyclase (AC) exhibited no obvious changes in quantal size or input resistance of postsynaptic muscle cells after HT rearing, suggesting an important role for rut AC in temperature-induced synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila. This extends our previous finding of rut-dependent synaptic homeostasis in hyperexcitable mutants, e.g. slowpoke (slo). In slo larvae, the lack of BK channel function is partially ameliorated by upregulation of presynaptic Sh IA current to limit excessive transmitter release in addition to postsynaptic glutamate receptor recomposition that reduces the quantal size.", "datePublished": "2015-09-11T15:12:53Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncel.2015.00010/full"], "eissn": "1662-5102", "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2015.00010", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Understanding the Pathophysiological Actions of Tau Oligomers: A Critical Review of Current Electrophysiological Approaches", "author": ["Emily Hill", "Mark J.

In humans, pathological forms of tau are implicated in a range of diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for maintaining the correct balance of tau phosphorylation to enable axons to be both stable and labile enough to function properly. In the early stages of tauopathies, this balance is interrupted leading to dissociation of tau from microtubules. This leaves microtubules prone to damage and phosphorylated tau prone to aggregation. Initially, phosphorylated tau forms oligomers, then fibrils, and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It is widely accepted that the initial soluble oligomeric forms of tau are probably the most pathologically relevant species but there is relatively little quantitative information to explain exactly what their toxic effects are at the individual neuron level. Electrophysiology provides a valuable tool to help uncover the mechanisms of action of tau oligomers on synaptic transmission within single neurons. Understanding the concentration-, time-, and neuronal compartment-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers on neuronal and synaptic properties are essential to understanding how best to counteract its effects and to develop effective treatment strategies.

One potential contributor is racial bias in pain perception &ndash; including low-level implicit biases and explicitly held lay-beliefs. Delays in seeking pain treatment may compound these disparities. However, experiments testing these factors in the context of Latinx-American pain are limited, and mechanisms by which Latinx-American group-membership influences pain perception and treatment are not understood.Methods: Here, Latinx-American and White-American participants read vignettes including a Latinx or White patient&rsquo;s pain description and numerical pain rating. Participants then rated how much pain they thought each patient was in using the same numerical scale. Participants also reported how much pain they themselves would need to experience to prompt treatment-seeking.Results: In contrast to prior work identifying lay beliefs that Latinx-Americans feel less pain than White-Americans, participants in the current study revealed a bias in the opposite direction. This was largely driven, however, by Latinx-American participants, who have been under-represented in previous studies of empathy and pain perception. Latinx-Americans ascribed more pain to patients overall &ndash; irrespective of patient race &ndash; relative to White-Americans. Latinx-American participants also reported that their own pain would need to be significantly more intense before seeing a doctor.Conclusion: These results suggest that, relative to White-Americans, Latinx-Americans may be more likely to believe people are in more pain than they report &ndash; or may be more perceptive of others&rsquo; pain &ndash; and that they may be in more pain upon presenting to medical settings.Keywords: disparities, race, ethnicity, empathy", "datePublished": "2019-11-11T01:51:55Z", "url": ["https://www.dovepress.com/the-influence-of-latinx-american-identity-on-pain-perception-and-treat-peer-reviewed-article-JPR"], "pissn": "1178-7090", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Legal and ethical issues of using brain imaging to diagnose pain", "author": ["Karen D.

Finally, the ethical, privacy, and legal implications of a brain-imaging\u2013based objective measure of pain are considered as potential future technological developments necessary to create a so-called \u201cpainometer test.\u201d", "datePublished": "2017-08-08T08:16:05Z", "url": ["http://journals.lww.com/painrpts/fulltext/10.1097/PR9.0000000000000577"], "eissn": "2471-2531", "doi": "10.1097/PR9.0000000000000577", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Phase-to-Phase With Nucleoli \u2013 Stress Responses, Protein Aggregation and Novel Roles of RNA", "author": ["Leena Latonen"], "description": "Protein- and RNA-containing foci and aggregates are a hallmark of many age- and mutation-related neurodegenerative diseases. This article focuses on the role the nucleolus has as a hub in macromolecule regulation in the mammalian nucleus. The nucleolus has a well-established role in ribosome biogenesis and functions in several types of cellular stress responses. In addition to known reactions to DNA damaging and transcription inhibiting stresses, there is an emerging role of the nucleolus especially in responses to proteotoxic stress such as heat shock and inhibition of proteasome function. The nucleolus serves as an active regulatory site for detention of extranucleolar proteins. This takes place in nucleolar cavities and manifests in protein and RNA collections referred to as intranucleolar bodies (INBs), nucleolar aggresomes or amyloid bodies (A-bodies), depending on stress type, severity of accumulation, and material propensities of the macromolecular collections. These indicate a relevance of nucleolar function and regulation in neurodegeneration-related cellular events, but also provide surprising connections with cancer-related pathways. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing these processes remain largely undefined. In this article, the nucleolus as the site of protein and RNA accumulation and as a possible protective organelle for nuclear proteins during stress is viewed. In addition, recent evidence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and liquid-solid phase transition in the formation of nucleoli and its stress responses, respectively, are discussed, along with the increasingly indicated role and open questions for noncoding RNA species in these events.", "datePublished": "2019-04-26T05:40:11Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncel.2019.00151/full"], "eissn": "1662-5102", "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2019.00151", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Optogenetic stimulation effectively enhances intrinsically generated network synchrony", "author": ["Ahmed eEl Hady", "Ahmed eEl Hady", "Ahmed eEl Hady", "Ahmed eEl Hady", "Ghazaleh eAfshar", "Ghazaleh eAfshar", "Kai eBroeking", "Kai eBroeking", "Kai eBroeking", "Oliver eSchl\u00fcter", "Oliver eSchl\u00fcter", "Oliver eSchl\u00fcter", "Theo eGeisel", "Theo eGeisel", "Theo eGeisel", "Theo eGeisel", "Walter eSt\u00fchmer", "Walter eSt\u00fchmer", "Walter eSt\u00fchmer", "Walter eSt\u00fchmer", "Fred eWolf", "Fred eWolf", "Fred eWolf", "Fred eWolf", "Fred eWolf"], "description": "Synchronized bursting is found in many brain areas and has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease and schizophrenia.

We combined electrical recording using multi-electrode array with optical stimulation of cultured channelrhodopsin-2 transducted hippocampal neurons to study and manipulate network burst synchronization. We found low frequency photo-stimulation protocols that are sufficient to induce potentiation of network bursting, modifying bursting dynamics and increasing interneuronal synchronization.

It is distinguished from other demyelinating conditions by the presence of AQP4-IgG and serum aquaporin 4 (AQP4), found mainly in the blood\u2013brain barrier. This descriptive study was conducted from January 2015 to June 2018 at the National Center for Neurological Sciences (NCNS) in Khartoum, Sudan. All participants were Sudanese patients diagnosed with NMO. In our study the selection of cases was based on Dean Wingerchuk diagnostic criteria (2006), which states that the diagnosis of NMO should meet two absolute criteria and two supportive criteria. The absolute criteria are myelitis and optic neuritis, whereas supportive criteria include radiological findings obtained from brain and spinal cord MRI. Furthermore, AQP4-IgG levels were measured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum using immunofluorescence. Data were collected by a pre-designed questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 17. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 31 patients were enrolled in this study [6 male (19.4%) and 25 female (80.6%)]. The mean age was 38\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u00a0years. Motor and visual difficulties were the initial symptoms and occurred in 21 (67.7%) and 10 (32.3%) patients, respectively. Fundoscopy confirmed optic atrophy in 22 (71.0%) patients. The course of the disease revealed one relapse in 21 patients (67.7%). Seropositive AQP4-IgG were seen in 23 patients (79.31%). There was a significant correlation between AQP4 and response to treatment (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.038). The correlation between serum AQP4-IgG, showed that, complete improvement was detected in 2 patients (6.9%) one of them was positive and the other was negative, 20 (69.0%) patients presented with some disability, among them 18 (62.1%) were positive and 2 (6.9%) were negative, while 7 patients showed no improvement (24.1%) 4 out of them were positive (13.8%) and 3 were negative (10.3%).

One of the processes that insulin stimulates is an increase in monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis. In this study, we performed experiments in vivo and in vitro to elucidate the signaling transduction pathways that are involved in insulin-induced monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis. We found that insulin stimulates THP-1 cell chemotaxis in a dose-dependent and insulin receptor-dependent manner. We also show that the kinases PI3K-Akt, SPAK/JNK, and p38 MAPK are key molecules in the insulin-induced signaling pathways that lead to chemoattraction of the THP-1 cell. Furthermore, both PI3K-Akt and SPAK/JNK signaling involve Rac1 activation, an important molecule in regulating cell motility. Indeed, topical application of Rac1 inhibitor at an early stage during the healing process caused delayed and impaired healing even in the presence of insulin. These results delineate cell and molecular mechanisms involved in insulin-induced chemotaxis of monocyte/macrophage, cells that are critical for proper healing.", "datePublished": "2018-03-26T15:18:04Z", "url": ["http://bio.biologists.org/content/7/1/bio026187"], "eissn": "2046-6390", "doi": "10.1242/bio.026187", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Glial Dysfunction in MeCP2 Deficiency Models: Implications for Rett Syndrome", "author": ["Uri Kahanovitch", "Kelsey  C.

However, understanding the underlying biological processes remains puzzling. Here we induced developmental cortical malformations in offspring, after intraventricular injection of methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in utero in mice. We combined extensive histological and electrophysiological studies to characterize the model. We found that MAM injections at E14 and E15 induced a range of cortical and hippocampal malformations resembling histological alterations of specific genetic mutations and transplacental mitotoxic agent injections. However, in contrast to most of these models, intraventricularly MAM-injected mice remained asymptomatic and showed no clear epilepsy-related phenotype as tested in long-term chronic recordings and with pharmacological manipulations. Instead, they exhibited a non-specific reduction of hippocampal-related brain oscillations (mostly in CA1); including theta, gamma and HFOs; and enhanced thalamocortical spindle activity during non-REM sleep. These data suggest that developmental cortical malformations do not necessarily correlate with epileptiform activity.

Here the behavioral and neural mechanisms of greater risk aversion were examined in young and old rats trained on an instrumental probability discounting task. Consistent with the literature, old rats showed greater discounting of reward value when the probability of obtaining rewards dropped below 100%. Behaviorally, reward magnitude discrimination was the same between young and old rats, and yet these same rats exhibited reduced sensitivity to positive, but not negative, choice outcomes. The latter behavioral result was congruent with additional findings that the aged ventral tegmental neurons (including dopamine cells) were less responsive to rewards when compared to the same cell types recorded from young animals.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare cortical network changes after 6 weeks of visually cued handwriting training (= experimental) with a placebo intervention to address micrographia, a common problem in PD. Twenty seven early Parkinson's patients on dopaminergic medication performed a pre-writing task in both the presence and absence of visual cues during behavioral tests and during fMRI. Subsequently, patients were randomized to the experimental (N = 13) or placebo intervention (N = 14) both lasting 6 weeks, after which they underwent the same testing procedure. We used dynamic causal modeling to compare the neural network dynamics in both groups before and after training. Most importantly, intensive writing training propagated connectivity via the left hemispheric visuomotor stream to an increased coupling with the supplementary motor area, not witnessed in the placebo group. Training enhanced communication in the left visuomotor integration system in line with the learned visually steered training. Notably, this pattern was apparent irrespective of the presence of cues, suggesting transfer from cued to uncued handwriting. We conclude that in early PD intensive motor skill learning, which led to clinical improvement, alters cortical network functioning.

In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states.

The role of innate immunity is frequently seen as a Yin and Yang in both diseases, but this depends on the environment, pre-clinical disease models and the type of cells involved.", "datePublished": "2019-08-02T08:23:43Z", "url": ["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncel.2019.00355/full"], "eissn": "1662-5102", "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2019.00355", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Construct Validity and Reliability of the SARA Gait and Posture Sub-scale in Early Onset Ataxia", "author": ["Tjitske F.

For reliable data entry of studies targeting at gait and posture improvement, uniform quantitative biomarkers are necessary. Until now, the pediatric test construct of gait and posture scores of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia sub-scale (SARA) is still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to validate the construct validity and reliability of the pediatric (SARAGAIT/POSTURE) sub-scale.Methods: We included 28 EOA patients [15.5 (6\u201334) years; median (range)]. For inter-observer reliability, we determined the ICC on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores by three independent pediatric neurologists. For convergent validity, we associated SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores with: (1) Ataxic gait Severity Measurement by Klockgether (ASMK; dynamic balance), (2) Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS; static balance), (3) Gross Motor Function Classification Scale -extended and revised version (GMFCS-E&amp;R), (4) SARA-kinetic scores (SARAKINETIC; kinetic function of the upper and lower limbs), (5) Archimedes Spiral (AS; kinetic function of the upper limbs), and (6) total SARA scores (SARATOTAL; i.e., summed SARAGAIT/POSTURE, SARAKINETIC, and SARASPEECH sub-scores). For discriminant validity, we investigated whether EOA co-morbidity factors (myopathy and myoclonus) could influence SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores.Results: The inter-observer agreement (ICC) on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores was high (0.97). SARAGAIT/POSTURE was strongly correlated with the other ataxia and functional scales [ASMK (rs = -0.819; p &lt; 0.001); PBS (rs = -0.943; p &lt; 0.001); GMFCS-E&amp;R (rs = -0.862; p &lt; 0.001); SARAKINETIC (rs = 0.726; p &lt; 0.001); AS (rs = 0.609; p = 0.002); and SARATOTAL (rs = 0.935; p &lt; 0.001)]. Comorbid myopathy influenced SARAGAIT/POSTURE scores by concurrent muscle weakness, whereas comorbid myoclonus predominantly influenced SARAKINETIC scores.Conclusion: In young EOA patients, separate SARAGAIT/POSTURE parameters reveal a good inter-observer agreement and convergent validity, implicating the reliability of the scale. In perspective of incomplete discriminant validity, it is advisable to interpret SARAGAIT/POSTURE scores for comorbid muscle weakness.", "datePublished": "2017-12-13T04:58:03Z", "url": ["http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00605/full"], "eissn": "1662-5161", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2017.00605", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Comparing MEG and EEG in detecting the ~20-Hz rhythm modulation to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation", "author": ["Mia Illman", "Kristina Laaksonen", "Mia Liljestr\u00f6m", "Veikko Jousm\u00e4ki", "Harri Piitulainen", "Nina Forss"], "description": "Modulation of the ~20-Hz brain rhythm has been used to evaluate the functional state of the sensorimotor cortex both in healthy subjects and patients, such as stroke patients. The ~20-Hz brain rhythm can be detected by both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), but the comparability of these methods has not been evaluated. Here, we compare these two methods in the evaluating of ~20-Hz activity modulation to somatosensory stimuli.Rhythmic ~20-Hz activity during separate tactile and proprioceptive stimulation of the right and left index finger was recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG in twenty-four healthy participants.Both tactile and proprioceptive stimulus produced a clear suppression at 300\u2013350\u00a0\u200bms followed by a subsequent rebound at 700\u2013900\u00a0\u200bms after stimulus onset, detected at similar latencies both with MEG and EEG. The relative amplitudes of suppression and rebound correlated strongly between MEG and EEG recordings. However, the relative strength of suppression and rebound in the contralateral hemisphere (with respect to the stimulated hand) was significantly stronger in MEG than in EEG recordings.Our results indicate that MEG recordings produced signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG, favoring MEG as an optimal tool for studies evaluating sensorimotor cortical functions. However, the strong correlation between MEG and EEG results encourages the use of EEG when translating studies to clinical practice. The clear advantage of EEG is the availability of the method in hospitals and bed-side measurements at the acute phase.", "datePublished": "2020-06-25T14:28:29Z", "url": ["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920302913"], "pissn": "1095-9572", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116804", "database": "DOAJ"}, {"title": "Live imaging of microtubule dynamics at excitatory presynaptic boutons in primary hippocampal neurons and acute hippocampal slices", "author": ["Xiaoyi Qu", "Atul Kumar", "Francesca Bartolini"], "description": "Summary: Analyses of microtubule (MT) plus end dynamics at glutamatergic en passant boutons can be carried out in cultured primary neurons isolated from mouse or rat embryos or ex vivo in acute slices isolated from mice that had been electroporated in utero.

Recent studies suggest improvement in cognitive speed, attention and executive functioning with physical activity. However, whether such improvements are activity specific is unclear.Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of one year age-adapted Taekwondo training on several cognitive functions, including reaction/ motor time, information processing speed, and working and executive memory, in 24 healthy volunteers over forty.Reaction and motor time decreased with 41.2 seconds and 18.4 seconds (p=0.004, p=0.015), respectively.
